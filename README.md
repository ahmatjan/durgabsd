### DurgaBSD is a proof of concept in the making. The aim and focus of DurgaBSD is to provide a solid and secure operating system # for pentesters who enjoy the BSD OS. The concept is basic and still encourages custom configurations per machine. But we are # #using this as a learning process in order provide a more user friendly version in the future. Currently DurgaBSD is built off # #FreeBSD 10.3 and currently we are not ready to move forward with FBSD11 for this project.
