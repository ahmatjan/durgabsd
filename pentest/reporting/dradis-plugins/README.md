[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/dradis/dradis-plugins.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/dradis/dradis-plugins) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/dradis/dradis-plugins.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/dradis/dradis-plugins.png)

This gem contains the base classes needed to manage the plugins in Dradis.

The Dradis 3 gemified plugin Engines need to include Dradis::Plugins::Base which is defined in this class.

Warning, we may end up merging this gem with Dradis::Core!!

The plugin requires Dradis 3.0 or higher.
