Note: Fireshark is meant for an experienced security researcher or enthusiast. Please take the proper precautions to make sure firesheark is running either in a virtualized environment or in an environment that doesn't effect the system permantely such as deepfreeze. 

the 2-second explainaion of how to use fireshark, is to do the following:

1) create a data.txt file in your home directory insert one or more URLs in the data.txt file
2) download and install fireshark by draging fireshark.xpi into your firefox browser. restart firefox, go to tools, and click on "go!"
3) wait and watch and fireshark visits each of the URLs that were inserted in the data.txt file
4) after all URLs have been visited, open the report.yml that will be found in your home directory, it should reference any source code, screenshots and deobfuscated code that was created while the browser was run
5) use the post-processing scripts e.g. graphviz.pl to process more interesting graphs against report.yml
any other post-processing is up to you
