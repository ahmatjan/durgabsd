MALIGNO v2.4 -> v2.5
=====================

1. MSF resource files are now generated with HandlerSSLCert option when payloads use https.
2. Maligno starts a proper MSF handler automatically when running in failsafe mode.
3. Failsafe payloads are now injected by the client after a 30 seconds pause. This is for giving time to MSF handler to start on the server side.
4. Fixed a bug that prevented clients from connecting to HTTP proxies under certain situations.
5. Client "Basic proxy authentication" support for non-Windows platforms.
6. Default Msfvenom path changed to "/usr/share/metasploit-framework/" in server config.
7. Clients are cleared out from the "clients" folder after server shutdown.
