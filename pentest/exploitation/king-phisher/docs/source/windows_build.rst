Windows Build
=============

Each release of King Phisher includes an MSI build of the client for easy use
on Windows systems. Creating this build is one of the last steps prior to
creating a new version release. The build is created using the Python
`cx_Freeze <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cx_Freeze>`_ package.

Before the build can be created the `PyGObject for Windows
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/pygobjectwin32/>`_ package must be installed.
While installing this package, it prompts for which GNOME libraries are to be
included. When the prompt appears the following packages should be selected.

- Base packages
- ATK
- GConf
- GDK-Pixbuf
- GTK+
- GTKSourceView
- GXML
- Pango
- Soup
- WebkitGTK

Once all packages have been installed and the King Phisher client is running
with Python, the "tools/build_msi.bat" script can be executed to create the
build. The build process will take a few minutes, but once completed an MSI
installer file will be created in a new "dist" directory in the projects root
folder.
