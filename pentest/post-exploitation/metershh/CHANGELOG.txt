version 2.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Replaced reverse forward with regular port forward and reverse_tcp payload. This change removes the need for any special handler on the attacker's side.

* Added much more resilient error checking.

* Added ability to specify ip and port from command line.

* Added support of RSA, DSA (DSS), ECDSA key authentication instead of passwords.

* Removed subprocess, multiprocess, and threading libraries and rewrote corresponding code to use only _thread. Code is much simplified and should be more compatible with py2exe.

* Upgrade to Python 3.4
