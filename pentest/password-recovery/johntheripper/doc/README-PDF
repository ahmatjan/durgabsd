Cracking PDF files with JtR
---------------------------

1. Run pdf2john.py on the .pdf file(s).

E.g. $ ../run/pdf2john.py test.pdf > hashes

2. Run john on the output of pdf2john.py program.

E.g. $ ../run/john hashes

In case of problems with the pdf2john.py tool, you may use the "npdf2john"
program (https://github.com/kholia/npdf2john) instead. Please report such
problems on the https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/issues page.
