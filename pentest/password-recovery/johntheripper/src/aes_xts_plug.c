/*****************************************************************************
 * we know first sector has Tweak value of 0. For this, we just AES a null 16
 * bytes, then do the XeX using the results for our xor, then modular mult
 * GF(2) that value for the next round.  NOTE, len MUST be an even multiple of
 * 16 bytes.  We do NOT handle CT stealing.  But the way we use it in the TC
 * format we only decrypt 16 bytes, and later (if it looks 'good'), we decrypt
 * the whole first sector (512-64 bytes) both which are even 16 byte data.
 * This code has NOT been optimized. It was based on simple reference code that
 * I could get my hands on.  However, 'mostly' we do a single limb AES-XTS which
 * is just 2 AES, and the buffers xored (before and after). There is no mulmod
 * GF(2) logic done in that case.   NOTE, there was NO noticeable change in
 * speed, from using original oSSL EVP_AES_256_XTS vs this code, so this code
 * is deemed 'good enough' for usage in this location.
 *
 * This was also used in vdi_fmt, so the code was pulled out of those files,
 * and a 'common' file was made.
 *
 * Note, modified to handle multiple width AES (currently 256 and 128 bits)
