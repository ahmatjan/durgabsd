    gem install typhoeus
    gem install nokogiri

####Installing on Mac OSX:

Apple Xcode, Command Line Tools and the libffi are needed (to be able to install the FFI gem), See [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17775115/cant-setup-ruby-environment-installing-fii-gem-error](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17775115/cant-setup-ruby-environment-installing-fii-gem-error)

####Installing with RVM (recommended):

    # Install all prerequisites for your OS (look above)
    cd ~
    curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
    source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
    echo "source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm" >> ~/.bashrc

#### KNOWN ISSUES

  - Typhoeus segmentation fault

      Update cURL to version => 7.21 (may have to install from source)

  - Proxy not working

      Update cURL to version => 7.21.7 (may have to install from source).

      Installation from sources :

        Grab the sources from http://curl.haxx.se/download.html
        Decompress the archive
        Open the folder with the extracted files
        Run ./configure
        Run make
        Run sudo make install
        Run sudo ldconfig


  - cannot load such file -- readline:

        sudo aptitude install libreadline5-dev libncurses5-dev

      Then, open the directory of the readline gem (you have to locate it)

        cd ~/.rvm/src/ruby-XXXX/ext/readline
        ruby extconf.rb
        make
        make install


      See [http://vvv.tobiassjosten.net/ruby-on-rails/fixing-readline-for-the-ruby-on-rails-console/](http://vvv.tobiassjosten.net/ruby-on-rails/fixing-readline-for-the-ruby-on-rails-console/) for more details

  - no such file to load -- rubygems

      ```update-alternatives --config ruby```

      And select your ruby version

      See [https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan/issues/148](https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan/issues/148)
