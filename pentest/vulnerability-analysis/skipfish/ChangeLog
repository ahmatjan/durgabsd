Version 2.10b:
  - Updated HTML tags and attributes that are checked for URL XSS
    injections to also include a few HTML5 specific ones

  - Updated test and description for semi-colon injection in HTML meta
    refresh tags (this is IE6 specific)

  - Relaxed HTML parsing a bit to allow spaces between HTML tag attributes
    and their values (e.g. "foo =bar").

  - Major update of LFI tests by adding more dynamic tests (double
    encoding, dynamic amount of ../'s for web.xml). The total amount of
    tests for this vulnerability is now 40 per injection point.

  - The RFI test is now a separate test and no longer requires special
    compile options. The default RFI URL and it's payload check are
    still defined in src/config.h.

  - Using the --flush-to-disk flag will cause requests and responses
    to be flushed to disk which reduces the memory footprint. (especially
    noticable in large scans)

  - Fixed a bug where in some conditions (e.g. a page looks similar to
    another) links were not scraped from responses which lead to links
    to be missed (thanks to Anurag Chaurasia for reporting)

  - Added configuration file support with the --config flag. In
    config/example.conf you can find flags and examples.

  - Several signature keyword enhancements have been made. Most
    significant are the "header" keyword, which allows header matching
    and the "depend" keyword which allows signature chaining.

  - Fixed basic authentication which was broken per 2.08b. Cheers to
    Michael Stevens for reporting.

  - Fixed -k scheduling where 1:0:0 would count as a second in stead of
    an hour (also visa versa). Cheers to Claudio Criscione for reporting.

  - Small fix to compile time warnings

Version 2.09b:

  - Fixed a crash that could be triggered during 404 fingerprint failures

  - Signature IDs for detected issues are now stored in the report
    JSON files.

  - Added mod_status, mod_info, MySQL dump, phpMyAdmin SQL dump and
    robots.txt signatures. 

  - Improved the Flash and Silverlight crossdomain policy signatures to
    only warn about them when they use wildcards.

Version 2.08b:

  - Added Host header XSS testing.

  - Added HTML encoding XSS tests to detect scenarios where our
    injection string ends up in an attributes that execute HTML encoded
    Javascript. For example: onclick.

  - Bruteforcing is now disabled for URLs that gave a directory listing.

  - Added subject alternate name checking for SSL certificates (cheers
    to Matt Caroll for his feedback)

  - Added signature matching (see doc/signatures.txt) which means a lot
    of the content based issues are no longer hardcoded.

  - Added active XSSI test. The passive XSSI stays (for now) but this
    active check is more acurate and will remove issues detected by the
    passive one if they cannot be confirmed. This reduces false positives

  - Added HTML tag XSS test which triggers when our payload is used
    as a tag attribute value but without quotes (courtesy of wavsep).

  - Added javascript: scheme XSS testing (courtesy of wavsep).

  - Added form based authentication. During these authenticated
    scans, skipfish will check if the session has ended and re-authenticates
    if necessary.

  - Fixed a bug where in slow scans the console output could mess up
    due to the high(er) refresh rate.

  - Fixed a bug where a missed response during the injection tests could
    result in a crash. (courtesy of Sebastian Roschke)

  - Restructure the source package a bit by adding a src/, doc/ and
    tools/ directory.

Version 2.07b:
--------------

  - A bugfix to fprint_response() will help reduce false positives that
    could occur for differential tests (i.e. the query and shell injection
    tests)

  - We now suppress implicit cache warnings when dealing with 302, 303 and 307
    redirects.

  - Added --no-checks which allows a scan to be run without any injection
    tests. This still allows bruteforcing and combines well with the
    new ability to load URLs from previous scan results.

  - We can now parse the pivots.txt, which can be found in the output
    directory of older scans. All URLs will be loaded which seriously
    speeds up recurring scans.

  - Directory bruteforcing now includes a content negotiation trick where
    a using a fake mime in the Accept: header will cause some servers to
    propose us files via a 406 response.

  - A horrible bug fix which caused instable pages not be marked
    as such. The result: false positives.


Version 2.06b:
--------------

  - Crawler update which gives more control over the injection test
    scheduling. This comes with the --checks and --checks-toggle
    flags to display and enable/disable checks.

  - Pages where the response varies are no longer completely
    discarded. Instead now we only disable tests that require stability
    which increases scan coverage.

  - Split the traversal and disclosure test to increase coverage:
    traversal checks require stable pages, the disclosure checks can be
    performed on all.

  - Updated dictionaries and converted them to use the dictionary
    optimisations we introduced in 2.03b

  - Fixed offline report viewing (thanks to Sebastian Roschke)

  - Added NULL byte file disclosure tests

  - Added JSP inclusion error check to analyse.c

  - Added XSS injection tests for cookies

  - Directory listings are now reported as individual (info-type) issues

  - Added warning in case the negotiated SSL cipher turns out to be a
    weak one (leaving the cipher enumeration to network scanners)

  - Added experimental -v flag which can be used to enable (limited)
    runtime reporting. This output is written to stderr and should be
    redirected to a file, unless you use the -u flag.

  - The man page has been rewritten and now includes detailed descriptions
    and examples.

  - A whole bunch of small bug fixes


Version 2.05b:
--------------

  - Fixed a NULL pointer crash when adding "callback" tests to JavaScript
    URLs that have a parameter with no value.

  - Bug fix in the redirect callback which expected 2 responses but
    since 2.04b actually should process 4.

Version 2.04b:
--------------

  - Option -V eliminated in favor of -W / -S.

  - Support for #ro, -W-; related documentation changes.

  - HTTPS -> HTTP form detection.

  - Added more diverse traversal and file disclosure tests (including file:// scheme tests)

  - Improved injection detection in <script> sections, where a ' or "
    is all we need to inject js code.

  - Added check to see if our injection strings end up server Set-Cookie,
    Set-Cookie2 and Content-Type reponse headers

  - URLs that give us a Javascript response are now tested with a
    "callback=" parameter to find JSONP issues.

  - Fixed "response varies" bug in 404 detection where a stable page would be marked unstable.

  - Bugfix to es / eg handling in dictionaries.
