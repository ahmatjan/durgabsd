Binaries
========

The binaries here have the naming scheme ``openssl.$(uname).$(uname -m)``
and will be picked up from testssl.sh if you run testssl.sh directly
off the git directory. Otherwise you need ``testssl.sh`` to point to it 
via the argument (``--openssl=<here>``) or as an environment variable
(``OPENSSL=<here> testssl.sh <yourargs>``).

The Linux binaries with the trailing ``-krb5`` come with Kerberos 5 support, 
they won't be automatically picked up as you need to make sure first they
run (see libraries below).

All the precompiled binaries provided here have extended support for
everything which is normally not in OpenSSL or LibreSSL -- 40+56 Bit,
export/ANON ciphers, weak DH ciphers, SSLv2 etc. -- all the dirty
features needed for testing. OTOH they also come with extended support
for new / advanced cipher suites and/or features which are not in the 
official branch like CHACHA20+POLY1305 and CAMELIA 256 bit ciphers.

The binaries in this directory are all compiled from an OpenSSL 1.0.2 fork
from Peter Mosmans (https://github.com/PeterMosmans/openssl). Thx a bunch, 
Peter!

Compiled Linux binaries so far come from Dirk, other contributors see ../CREDITS.md .


Compiling and Usage Instructions
================================

General
-------

Both 64+32 bit Linux binaries were compiled under Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. Likely you
cannot use them for older distributions, younger worked in all my test environments. 
I provide for each distributions two sets of binaries:

* completely statically linked binaries
* dynamically linked binaries, additionally with MIT Kerberos support ("krb5" in the name).
  They provide also KRB5-* and EXP-KRB5-* support (in OpenSSL terminology, see krb5-ciphers.txt). 

For the latter you need a whopping bunch of kerberos runtime libraries which you maybe need to 
install from your distributor (libgssapi_krb5, libkrb5, libcom_err, libk5crypto, libkrb5support, 
libkeyutils). The 'static' binaries do not have MIT kerberos support as there are no
static kerberos libs and I did not bother to compile them from the sources.


Compilation instructions
------------------------

If you want to compile OpenSSL yourself, here are the instructions:

1.) get openssl from Peter Mosmans' repo:

     git clone https://github.com/PeterMosmans/openssl
     cd openssl

2.) configure the damned thing. Options I used (see https://github.com/drwetter/testssl.sh/blob/master/utils/make-openssl.sh)

**for 64Bit including Kerberos ciphers:**

    ./config --prefix=/usr/ --openssldir=/etc/ssl enable-zlib enable-ssl2 enable-rc5 enable-rc2 \
    enable-GOST enable-cms enable-md2 enable-mdc2 enable-ec enable-ec2m enable-ecdh enable-ecdsa \
    enable-seed enable-camellia enable-idea enable-rfc3779 enable-ec_nistp_64_gcc_128 \
    --with-krb5-flavor=MIT experimental-jpake -DOPENSSL_USE_BUILD_DATE

**for 64Bit, static binaries:**

    ./config --prefix=/usr/ --openssldir=/etc/ssl enable-zlib enable-ssl2 enable-rc5 enable-rc2 \
    enable-GOST enable-cms enable-md2 enable-mdc2 enable-ec enable-ec2m enable-ecdh enable-ecdsa \
    enable-seed enable-camellia enable-idea enable-rfc3779 enable-ec_nistp_64_gcc_128 \
    -static experimental-jpake -DOPENSSL_USE_BUILD_DATE

**for 32 Bit including Kerberos ciphers:**

    ./config --prefix=/usr/ --openssldir=/etc/ssl enable-zlib enable-ssl2 enable-rc5 enable-rc2 \
    enable-GOST enable-cms enable-md2 enable-mdc2 enable-ec enable-ec2m enable-ecdh enable-ecdsa \
    enable-seed enable-camellia enable-idea enable-rfc3779 no-ec_nistp_64_gcc_128 \
    --with-krb5-flavor=MIT experimental-jpake -DOPENSSL_USE_BUILD_DATE

 **for 32 Bit, static binaries:**

    ./config --prefix=/usr/ --openssldir=/etc/ssl enable-zlib enable-ssl2 enable-rc5 enable-rc2 \
    enable-GOST enable-cms enable-md2 enable-mdc2 enable-ec enable-ec2m enable-ecdh enable-ecdsa \
    enable-seed enable-camellia enable-idea enable-rfc3779 no-ec_nistp_64_gcc_128 \
    -static experimental-jpake -DOPENSSL_USE_BUILD_DATE 

(IPv6 would need additionally ``-DOPENSSL_USE_IPV6`` and the patch from ``fedora-dirk-ipv6.diff``
-- this doesn't give you the option of an IPv6 enabled proxy -- yet.)

Four GOST [1][2] ciphers come via engine support automagically with this setup. Two additional GOST 
ciphers can be compiled in (``GOST-GOST94``, ``GOST-MD5``) with ``-DTEMP_GOST_TLS`` but as of now they make problems under rare circumstances, so unless you desperately need those ciphers I would stay away from ``-DTEMP_GOST_TLS``.

If you don't have / don't want Kerberos libraries and devel rpms/debs, just omit "--with-krb5-flavor=MIT"
(see examples).  If you have another Kerberos flavor you would need to figure out by yourself.

3.) make depend

4.) make

5.) make report (check whether it runs ok!)

6.) ``./apps/openssl ciphers -V 'ALL:COMPLEMENTOFALL' | wc -l`` lists for me
* 191(+4 GOST) ciphers -- including kerberos 
* 177(+4 GOST) ciphers without kerberos

as opposed to 111/109 from Ubuntu or Opensuse. 

**Never use these binaries for anything other than testing**

Enjoy, Dirk
