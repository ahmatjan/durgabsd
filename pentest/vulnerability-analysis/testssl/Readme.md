`testssl.sh` is a free command line tool which checks a server's service on
any port for the support of TLS/SSL ciphers, protocols as well as some
cryptographic flaws.

#### Key features

* Clear output: you can tell easily whether anything is good or bad
* Ease of installation: It works for Linux, Darwin, FreeBSD and
  MSYS2/Cygwin out of the box: no need to install or configure something,
  no gems, CPAN, pip or the like.
* Flexibility: You can test any SSL/TLS enabled and STARTTLS service, not
  only webservers at port 443
* Toolbox: Several command line options help you to run YOUR test and
  configure YOUR output
* Reliability: features are tested thoroughly
* Verbosity: If a particular check cannot be performed because of a missing
  capability on your client side, you'll get a warning
* Privacy: It's only you who sees the result, not a third party
* Freedom: It's 100% open source. You can look at the code, see what's
  going on and you can change it.
* Heck, even the development is open (github)

#### General

Here in the master branch you find the development version of the software
-- with new features and maybe some bugs. For the stable version and **a
more thorough description of the command line options** please see
[testssl.sh](https://testssl.sh/ "Go to the site with the stable version
and more documentation").

testssl.sh is working on every Linux/BSD distribution out of the box with
some limitations of disabled features from the openssl client -- some
workarounds are done with bash-socket-based checks. It also works on other
unixoid system out of the box, supposed they have `/bin/bash` and standard
tools like sed and awk installed. MacOS X and Windows (using MSYS2 or
cygwin) work too. OpenSSL version >= 1 is a must.  OpenSSL version >= 1.0.2
is needed for better LOGJAM checks and to display bit strengths for key
exchanges.

#### Current Development

Planned features in the release 2.7dev/2.8 are:

https://github.com/drwetter/testssl.sh/milestones/2.7dev%20%282.8%29

Done so far:

* Trust chain check against certificate stores from Apple (OS), Linux (OS),
  Microsoft (OS), Mozilla (Firefox Browser), works for openssl >=1.0.1
* IPv6 (status: 80% working, details see
  https://github.com/drwetter/testssl.sh/issues/11
* works on servers requiring a x509 certificate for authentication
* SSL Session ID check
* avahi/mDNS based name resolution
* HTTP2/ALPN protocol check
* Logging to a file / dir
* Logging to JSON + CSV
* check for multiple server certificates
* browser cipher simulation
* assistance for color-blind users
* Even more compatibility improvements for FreeBSD, RH-ish and F5 systems
* Considerable speed improvements for each cipher runs (-e/-E)
* OpenSSL 1.1.0 compliant
