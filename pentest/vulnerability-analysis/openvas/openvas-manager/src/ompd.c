/**
 * @file  ompd.c
 * @brief The OpenVAS Manager OMP daemon.
 *
 * This file defines the OpenVAS Manager daemon.  The Manager serves the OpenVAS
 * Management Protocol (OMP) to clients such as OpenVAS-Client.  The Manager
 * and OMP give clients full access to an OpenVAS Scanner.
 *
 * The library provides two functions: \ref init_ompd and \ref serve_omp.
 * \ref init_ompd initialises the daemon.
 * \ref serve_omp serves OMP to a single client socket until end of file is
 * reached on the socket.

   *   - the program must read from or write to an fd returned by select
   *     before selecting on the fd again,
   *   - the program need only select on the fds for writing if there is
   *     something to write,
   *   - similarly, the program need only select on the fds for reading
   *     if there is buffer space available,
   *   - the buffers from_client and from_scanner can become full during
   *     reading
   *   - a read from the client can be stalled by the to_scanner buffer
   *     filling up, or the to_client buffer filling up (in which case
   *     process_omp_client_input will try to write the to_client buffer
   *     itself),
