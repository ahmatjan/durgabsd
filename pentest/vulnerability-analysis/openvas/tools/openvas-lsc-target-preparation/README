openvas-lsc-target-preparation
------------------------------

To prepare a shell script that can be used to create RPMs
that make target systems ready for OpenVAS Local Security Checks (LSCs),
follow these instructions. The resulting shell script
could be used e.g. by OpenVAS-Client's key manager.

	make self

The resulting shell script can be used like this:

	sh openvas-lsc-rpm-creator.sh --target /abs/path/to/temp/working/dir /absolute/path/to/id_rsa_pubkey.pub

After successfull execution, a resulting rpm package will be placed in the
directory provided with --target.
Be sure to clean up the provided directory afterwards!
Ommitting the --target argument might work. Then, contents are extracted into a
'blubber' directory. It is generally suggested to provide the directory and
remove it afterwards yourself.

To test the functionality inside this directory, please execute ( with
the name "John Doe" as an example)

	sh create-rpm.sh id_rsa_johndoe.pub

to create an RPM to install on target machines using this specific
public key as secure access requirement via ssh.

For further development:

If you want to include more files or directories into this shellscript
build system, do before

	make distclean

then add the files, and do a

	make manifest

The version number resides in the file "VERSION".

BUGS:
	The system is likely to fail, if its parent directory or included
	files contain spaces in filenames, or other characters which need
	to be quoted for being used well in a UNIX shell.
