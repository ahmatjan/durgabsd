	* openvas-lsc-target.spec.in (%postun): Check /etc/passwd line of user
	to delete to prevent accidental removal of existing users in
	alien-converted package. The packages in question run the postun step
	even if prep or prein steps fail, thus eventually removing users that
	existed prior to installation-attempt of the package.

	Fixed a bug. Output of ls differs in ordering depending on the locale.
	In the Makefile, the diff command compares ls output with MANIFEST,
	leading to wrong results if these files are sorted differently.
	Found in cooperation with Matthew Mundell.

	* MANIFEST: Sorted "traditionally".

	* Makefile: Set locale to have the ls command sort "traditionally".
