How to install nasl.vim for syntax highlighting in VIM
------------------------------------------------------

1. Create folder ~/.vim/syntax (within your home folder)
2. Put nasl.vim into ~/.vim/syntax/
3. Edit ~/.vimrc and add the following:

syntax on
autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *.nasl set filetype=nasl
autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *.inc set filetype=nasl

As an alternative you also can switch syntax highlighting
on and off on demand by using the following commands:

:syntax on
:syntax off

instead of adding the "syntax on" statement to your .vimrc
(The autocmd still needs to be added).

How to get simple autocomplete
------------------------------------------------------

1. Create folder ~/.vim/plugin (within your home folder)
2. Create folder ~/.vim/openvas (within your home folder)
3. Put nasl.vim.autocomplete_plugin into ~/.vim/plugin/nasl.vim
4. Put vim_autocomplete_nasl_func_names into ~/.vim/openvas
5. Edit ~/.vimrc and add the following:

  autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.nasl set filetype=nasl
  autocmd FileType nasl setlocal completefunc=NaslComplete

or use

 :set completefunc=NaslComplete

In insert mode type for example "g" and then "CTRL-x u" to get a
dropdown with all functions beginning with "g".
