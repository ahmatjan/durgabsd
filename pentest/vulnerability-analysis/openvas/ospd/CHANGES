is to offer a powerful unified interface for different security scanners
and make their control flow and scan results consistently available under
the central OpenVAS Manager service.

The design supports wrapping arbitrary scanners with same protocol OSP
(OpenVAS Scanner Protocol), sharing the core daemon options while adding
scanner specific parameters and options.

Central features of ospd are:

* A base class for arbitrary OSP scanner that offers all standard features
  of such a wrapper daemon.

* OSP documentation.
