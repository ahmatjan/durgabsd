About OSPD
----------

OSPD is a base class for scanner wrappers which share the same communication
protocol: OSP (OpenVAS Scanner Protocol). OSP creates a unified interface for
different security scanners and make their control flow and scan results
consistently available under the central OpenVAS Manager service.

OSP is similar in many ways to OMP (OpenVAS Management Protocol): XML-based,
stateless and non-permanent connection.

The design supports wrapping arbitrary scanners with same protocol OSP,
sharing the core daemon options while adding scanner specific parameters and
options.

How to write your own OSP Scanner Wrapper
-----------------------------------------

As a core you need to derive from the class OSPDaemon from ospd.py.
See the documentation there for the single steps to establish the
full wrapper.

See the file INSTALL about how to register a OSP scanner at
the OpenVAS Manager which will automatically establish a full GUI
integration for the Greenbone Security Assistant (GSA).
