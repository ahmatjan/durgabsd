<h2>OpenVAS Change Request #8: Introduce NVT family "Credentials"</h2>

Status: Voted +2. Implemented. Server-side changes released with openvas-plugins 1.0.2, client-side released with OpenVAS-Client 1.0.4.

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>
To consistently mark those NVTs that transfer user input on credentials into the knowledge base
by setting the family to "Credentials".
</p>

<h3>References</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://lists.wald.intevation.org/pipermail/openvas-plugins/2008-April/000040.html">Initial discussion on openvas-plugins mailing list where this request emerged from</a>.
</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>
OpenVAS-Client offers a configuration page on "Credentials". It summarizes
those "plugin preferences" that are managing parameters for logging in
somewhere. OpenVAS-Client identifies them currently by hard-coded names (which is
a behavior inherited from Nessus).
</p>

<p>
Apparently names can change or new ones can appear. It is considered a broken
concept to have it necessary to change this in the client application each time
such a change occurs. Instead, the client should flexible react on changes happened
in OpenVAS server.
</p>

<h3>Effects</h3>

<ul>
<li> During a transition phase some credential settings may not appear (any more)
     in the Credentials page, but only in the Plugin Preferences page in OpenVAS-Client.

<li> The current concept of NASL/NTP allows for arbitrary languages of the family name.
     Thus, if "Credentials" as family name is hard coded into OpenVAS-Client, then
     the translation of this name is not identified as a credentials script and will
     only be shown in the preferences page. This is mostly a theoretical problem, because
     the number of the relevant script is quite low and mostly static.
     Also, the failures would happen already (e.g. logins.nasl) because the names are translatable as well.
</ul>

<h3>Design and Implementation</h3>

<ul>
<li> Change family to "Credentials" for ssh_authorization.nasl
     in openvas-plugins/scripts/.

<li>  openvas-plugins/scripts/logins.nasl: separate SMB into a nasl file
      of its own, e.g. as "smb_authorization.nasl" and set the
      family of both to "Credentials".
      Note that actually, logins.nasl should eventually be further resolved into
      separate scripts.

<li> In openvas-client/nessus/prefs_dialog/prefs_dialog_plugins_prefs.c
     change is_credentials to return true for family members of "Credentials".
     Or replace call of this function entirely by direct check for this family.

<li> While we are at it: Change the "Credentials" page of OpenVAS-Client to work
     in the same way as the Preferences page, i.e. have a overview
     and allow the user to click on the respective credentials name
     to change the values.
     This is basically intended to have a more consistent user interface.
</ul>
