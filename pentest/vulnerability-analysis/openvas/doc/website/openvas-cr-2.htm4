PAGE_START
<h2>OpenVAS Change Request #2: Remove any support for NSR export format of OpenVAS-Client</h2>

Status: Voted +4. Implemented with SVN 673. Released with OpenVAS-Client 1.0.3.

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>
To reduce code base.
</p>

<p>
To not let people use or create broken-by-design
export files.
</p>

<h3>References</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://lists.wald.intevation.org/pipermail/openvas-devel/2008-February/000585.html">Discussion on openvas-devel mailing list</a>
</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>
NSR was already marked as deprecated before OpenVAS fork from Nessus.
It is not expected to have any users still need or have NSR report files.
</p>

<p>
NSR is broken-by-design: NSR is a line-oriented format and escaping of
newlines is done with replacing newlines with a semicolon.
No escaping for semicolon is defined.
This problem is inherited directly from the Nessus protocol where the escaping
is already broken. Removing NSR is thus a first step to remove the basic
design flaw.
</p>

<p>
As a side-effect the code base can be reduced which is good for a higher
quality rating.
</p>

<h3>Effects</h3>

<ul>
<li> Users will not be able any more to export reports in NSR format.
<li> Users will not be able any more to import old NSR formats with
     new versions of OpenVAS-Client. Old version can be retrieved to
     perform the conversion to another format, so migration path is
     available.
</ul>

<h3>Design and Implementation</h3>

<ul>
<li> Remove any nsr related functions under openvas-client/nessus/.
     Note that arglist_to_file() is used in module html_graph_output and needs
     clarification.
<li> Remove nsr related stuff from openvas-client/doc/
<li> Remove nsr related stuff from openvas-manual/
</ul>
