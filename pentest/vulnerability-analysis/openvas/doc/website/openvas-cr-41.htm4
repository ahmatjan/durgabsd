<h2>OpenVAS Change Request #41: Adoption of CVSS Standard</h2>

<p>
Status: Voted +4. Done.
</p>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>
To adopt CVSS as explicit vulnerability severity scoring system so that
the CVSS scores can be automatically processed internally for reporting
and statistics.
</p>

<h3>References</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://www.first.org/cvss/">CVSS Standard </a>
</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>
<p>
CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) provides universal open and
standardized method for rating vulnerabilities. Currently, CVSS is used by
some of the NVT Developers to define the severity category. However, most
NVTs are developed based on a CVE and any CVE is associated with a CVSS.
Current practice of the NVT developers is to add the CVSS score
as part of the general NVT description text. Obviously, the CVSS in the text
cannot be processed in automatic ways.
</p>

<p>
To allow for automatic processing of CVSS, these data need to be formally
represented.
A standard way to do so would be to use the script_tag() function like it
is used for other NVT attributes already.
</p>

<p>
Based on script_tag(), the CVSS scoring would be related to NVTs and
since scan results have a relation to the NVTs, statistics and other
algorithmic processes can be implemented for the analysis of reports.
</p>
<p>
It is of course not possible to have all NVT's associated with a CVSS
score and thus CVSS-based statistics need to keep this in mind.
Also some NVTs combine more than one CVE and it will be unclear in such
cases which CVSS to apply.
</p>
<h3>Effects</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li> All the existing NVT's that are using CVSS Scoring in the description text
will instead use the script_tag() function inside the if(description)
section of the NVT.
Hence the CVSS score will not appear as part of the report text in the Client
but instead it'll be listed as one of the NVT's attribute like script_cve_id
and others. For clients that do not show tags this means the user won't easily
see the CVSS values anymore.

</ul>

<h3>Design and Implementation</h3>

<p>
The implementation needs to incorporate the following changes:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Update all NVT's that are currently using CVSS score to use,
script_tag("cvss_base", x.y) and script_tag("cvss_temporal", x.y) format, where
x and y are score indicators from 0 and upto 10. Also remove the CVSS Score
that is currently embedded in the description.

<li> Update all NVT's that refer to CVE through script_cve_id() to also
include CVSS score through script_tag("cvss_base", x.y) and
script_tag("cvss_temporal", x.y).

<li> Update the compendium describing the procedure to add CVSS scores in
NVT's.
</ul>
