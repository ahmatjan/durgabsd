<h2>GUI Translations</h2>

<p>
The Web GUI "Greenbone Security Assistant" supports localized language
support. Each user can switch to his preferred language under "My Settings".
</p>

<h3>Supported Language</h3>

<ul>
<li> OpenVAS-8 (1653 strings)
  <ul>
  <li> English (100%, default) </li>
  <li> German  (100%) </li>
  <li> Chinese (100%) </li>
  <li> Russian  (24%) </li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Add a new language!</h3>

<p>
Any further supported language is appreciated! And actually it is quite simple.
You can either do the following or you can contact info@greenbone.net to get an
account for a pootle translation web service.
</p>

<ul>
<li> Get the current "pot"-file: You can create it from the source of package "gsa"
     or just ask for a current one on the mailing list.
     <b>It makes sense to drop a note when you start the works, so that no
     one else works on the same in parallel.</b>
</li>
<li> Translate the English content to your language with one of the tools that can handle pot-files,
     for example "poedit" as available on most Linux-Systems.
</li>
<li> Send us the resulting translation file and we will integrate it, provided
     you agree to publish it under license condition "GPLv2+".
</ul>

<p>
All of the details on how to add/update translations on your own are described
in the file "gsa/doc/i18n-howto.txt".
</p>

<p>
If you have any questions about this procedure, just let us know
on our mailing list.
</p>

<p>
The online help content is translated in a different way, please refer to
the i18n howto or ask on the mailing list.
