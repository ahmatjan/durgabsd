<h3>April 2nd, 2015 - OpenVAS-8 released: Charts, Quality of Detection and PostgreSQL-Support</h3>

<p>
Following the annual release cycle, the new generation of OpenVAS [1] has been
released. The new version of the open framework for vulnerability scanning and
management, OpenVAS-8, introduces a comprehensively extended and improved
feature set. Advances and improvements were achieved in virtually all areas.
</p>

<p>
Highlights of this new release are the chart module for a variety of graphical
representation, the Quality of Detection (QoD) concept and the optional support
of PostgreSQL as database backend. Major advances were also achieved for the
access control management: more roles, group admins and super-admin to name just
a few. Notable as well is the introduction of the optional multi-scanner support
via the new protocol OSP (OpenVAS Scanner Protocol) for which a growing number
of servers is expected for the future. Last but not least, the OpenVAS Scanner
now requires less ressources and uses redis[2] for the inter-process communication.
</p>

<p>
All in all OpenVAS-8 ships 28 new and improved features, accompanied with
countless smaller changes. The systematic improvements and reliable release of
one major update every twelve months once again underlines the position of
OpenVAS as the most advanced Open Source solution for vulnerability management.
The new version can be downloaded free and is available as Free Software under
the GNU GPL license.
</p>

<p>
The company Greenbone Networks [3] develops and uses OpenVAS as a base for its
appliance product family for vulnerability scanning and management. Together
with the company SecPod [4] and the growing community, new vulnerability tests
and feature improvements are developed on a daily basis. The German Federal
Office for Information Security (BSI) [5] supports and utilizes OpenVAS,
together with many other federal agencies, as part of their IT security
framework.
</p>


<p>
Vulnerability Management:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Access Control:<br/>

  The access control features were comprehensively extended.

  <ul>
  <li>Roles can now be dynamically configured.</li>

  <li>New default roles "Monitor", "Guest" and "Super Admin".</li>

  <li> New Permissions "Super" that allows for example to define an
    administrator for a group.</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li> Results are now an explicit part of the scan management.<br/>

  The new section "Results" under menu "Scan Management" offers an object
  management for all of the scan results in the database a user has
  permission for. In other words, searching and filtering for results
  is now possible independent of a scan report.
</li>

<li> Solution Type:<br/>

  NVTs are now associated with a solution type like for example "VendorFix".
  This allows to group or identify NVTs or results where for example a
  simple solution exists or no solution is currently available.<br/>

  The Feed content is updated over time to add a solution type for all of
  the NVTs. At the time of writing, 3.6% of the NVTs own a Solution Type.
</li>

<li> Quality of Detection (QoD):<br/>

  The QoD is a value between 0% and 100% describing the reliability of the
  executed vulnerability detection or product detection.<br/>

  One of the main reasons to introduce this concept was to handle the
  challenge of potential vulnerabilities properly. The goal was to keep
  such in the results database but only visible on demand.<br/>

  While the QoD range allows to express the quality pretty refined, in fact
  most of the test routines use a standard methodology. Therefore the QoD
  Types were introduced of which each is associated with a QoD value.<br/>

  The Feed content is updated over time to add a QoD for all NVTs. Any NVT
  not explicitly assigned will apply 75% and therefore visible by default
  in order to not change the default behavior compared to OpenVAS-7.
  However, meanwhile any NVTs formerly requiring the "paranoid" setting
  in the scan configuration is now reporting always but stay invisible
  in the database until the user decides to view results with a lower
  quality of detection.<br/>

  At the time of writing, 2.7% of the NVTs own a QoD Type.
</li>

<li> New SecInfo object type "CERT-Bund" introduced: These are advisories
  published by the German federal CERT.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Vulnerability Scanning:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Credentials:

  <li> The public key of SSH credentials is not required anymore because it is
    extracted from the private key.
</li>

  <li> Credentials for ESXi target systems can now be configured directly with
    the Target object instead of in the Scan Configuration object.
</li>

<li> When a task is requested to stop, the scanner will now be advised to switch
  immediately into the final phase of scanning. With OpenVAS-7 the scanner
  immediately stopped activity and did not return so far collected host
  details. With OpenVAS-8 this is now transferred to the the database. 
</li>

<li> Dropped support for pausing of tasks entirely (was removed from GUI before,
  now removed from OMP level).
</li>

<li> OpenVAS Scanning Protocol (OSP):<br/>

  This new protocol allows to control a vulnerability scanner. The main
  elements are to set parameters, start a scan and retrieve results.
  OSP is designed in the same way as OMP, therefore it is a non-permanent
  request-response connection based on XML.<br/>

  It is possible to configure and control OSP-compliant Scanner via the
  user interface.<br/>

  OpenVAS-8 offers some pilot OSP scanners in order to provide examples for
  this technology. Users and developers are encouraged to wrap more
  vulnerability scanner with OSP and provide feedback on missing features
  in the OSP protocol.<br/>

  The OpenVAS Scanner itself is still OTP-based and the integration with
  OpenVAS Manager works like before with the slight difference that it
  is now possible to define more than one OpenVAS Scanner to be controlled
  by OpenVAS Manager.<br/>

  This new concepts introduces various changes in the user interface but
  defaults are set to keep the same behavior as in OpenVAS-7 if user decides
  not to deal with OSP. In other words: OSP is entirely optional.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Graphical User Interface:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Dynamic charts are introduced, using the Javascript library "d3". The first
  chart types (bar, donut, bubbles, line) are used for the SecInfo section
  in order to demonstrate some of the capabilities.<br/>

  The chart objects allow to download the data as CSV table or SVG graphics.
  Also, a HTML table can be opened and some of the charts are interactive.<br/>

  The underlying data aggregation technology is generically integrated into
  the protocol OMP. This allows to add more charts during the lifecycle of
  the OpenVAS release because no API changes are required.<br/>

  For the SecInfo Management, a first dashboard is integrated which assembles
  four of the charts and can be configured individually.<br/>

  The charting feature is entirely optional: Without enabling Javascript support
  in the browser no core functionality is lost. Also, the chart view can be collapsed
  so that only the traditional table view is shown.
</li>

<li> Bulk actions are introduced. For example this allows to remove or download many
  objects within a single action.
</li>

<li> The powerfilter was simplified to carry only the essential filter elements. The
  standard ones are displayed below and of course it is possible to apply any of
  them in the text entry field.
</li>

<li> Timezones:<br/>

  The configuration of timezones was changed so that now there is offered a drop
  down list of available timezones instead of a entry field for specifying the
  timezone in text form.
</li>

<li> Users are now allowed to have multiple simultaneous sessions, as long as
  the sessions are on different browsers. Up-to OpenVAS-7, a second session
  always invalidated the previous one regardless of which browser is used.
</li>

<li> For any web interface page, the duration of the backend operation will be
  shown at the bottom.
</li>

<li> The filenames for downloads can now be configured via "My Settings".
</li>

<li> New wizard for modifying a task.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Protocols:
</p>

<ul>
<li> OMP now in version 6.0

<li> The new OSP for controlling arbitrary scanners is at version 1.0.
</li>

<li> The OTP protocol was further reduced. It is not recommended to use
  it to communicate with the OpenVAS Scanner because it will eventually
  be dropped in favor of OSP. For the time being OMP should be used
  to control a OpenVAS Scanner.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Architecture:
</p>

<ul>
<li> redis (mandatory):<br/>

  The OpenVAS Scanner now uses a redis backend to share the knwoledge base
  among the scanning processes.
</li>

<li> PostgreSQL (optional):<br/>

  OpenVAS Manager now allows to use PostgreSQL as an alternative for the
  file-based SQLite. Everything should work, but this new database backend
  has seen little testing so far.<br/>

  The OpenVAS development team is prepared to fix any issues promptly as
  it is desired to make this database eventually the new default backend.
</li>

<li> openvas-smb (optional):<br/>

  The new module "openvas-smb" is used for WMI support.
  This is the former externally maintained wmi client library.
  Since it was actually not maintained anymore, the module was
  cut down to the essentials and furnished with a "cmake" build
  environment.
</li>

<li> OSP (optional):<br/>

  For the new OSP, a base module "OSPd" written in Python is made available.
  The actual wrappers for vulnerability scanners are collected as "osp-scanners"
  and the name of the modules is prefixed with "OSPd-". "OSPd" is a mandatory
  requirement for each OSP scanner module. <br/>

  All sample OSP scanners are writtin in Python. Currently the C-library API
  only supports OSP client functionality, not server functionality.
</li>

<li>
  The memory consumption of the OpenVAS Scanner was reduced by about 50%.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>April 25th, 2014 - OpenVAS-7 released: Unified Severity Concept and Access Control Management</h3>

<p>
Following the annual release cycle, the new generation of OpenVAS
[1] has been released. The new version of the open framework for
vulnerability scanning and management, OpenVAS-7, introduces a comprehensively
extended and improved feature set.
Main advances/improvements were undertaken in three domains:
improvements to the user interface for power users as well as for
beginners, access control and module architecture improvements. 
</p>

<p>
Highlights of this new release are the object tagging, replacememt of threat
view by severity view and a new report browser.
Another major change is the introduction of access control with groups, roles
and permissions. On the architectural side two modules were dropped,
the Administrator has been merged into Manager and the desktop client GSD
has been dropped in favor of focussing web client advances.
</p>

<p>
All in all OpenVAS-7 ships 37 new and improved features, accompanied with
countless smaller changes. The systematic improvements and reliable release
of one major update every twelve months once again underlines the position of OpenVAS as
the most advanced Open Source solution for vulnerability management. The
new version can be downloaded free and is available as Free Software under
the GNU GPL license.
</p>

<p>
The company Greenbone Networks [2] develops and uses OpenVAS as a base for
its appliance product family for vulnerability scanning and management.
Together with the company SecPod [3] and the growing community, new
vulnerability tests and feature improvements are developed on a daily basis.
The German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI)
[4] supports and utilizes OpenVAS, together with many other federal
agencies, as part of their IT security framework.
</p>

<p>
OpenVAS-7 can be experienced live at the Linuxtag Conference and Exhibition
in Berlin (Germany) [5] from 8th to 10th of May 2014 at the BSI booth.
</p>

<p>
Access Control:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Groups: For access permissions users can now be associated with Groups.
     The web interface allows full management of these groups for users with
     Administrator role.
</li>

<li> Roles: Roles are now freely configurable and users can be associated
     with roles. A new pre-configured role "Info" was added.
</li>

<li> Permissions: Under menu "Configuration" there is now a new item "Permissions".
     Here the user has a comfortable overview on all of his access permissions
     and opportunities to manage them.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Scanning:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Alive-Test (Up-Test, Ping-Test): The type of test that determines whether
     a system is active is now adjustable as a property
     of the object "Target". Which means it can be changed without the need to change
     Tasks or Scan Configurations. Possible methods are the same as before: ICMP, TCP
     and ARP.<br/>

     The default setting for the Alive-Test changes from ICMP&TCP&ARP to just ICMP.
     Hence it can happen that results change for some of your Tasks because some systems
     are not regarded as alive anymore. But in most cases where larger IP ranges are
     scanned the scan duration will significantly drop down while  getting the same results.
     However, you do not need
     to change a Scan Configuration or Task to get back to the previous state, you just
     need to adjust the Alive-Test method for the respective Target.
</li>

<li> New pre-configure Scan Configuration "Host Discovery". This Scan Configuration
     simply searches for real systems for the given target addresses. No vulnerability
     tests are executed. The result is just a list of hosts that are regarded active.
</li>

<li> New pre-configure Scan Configuration "System Discovery". This Scan Configuration
     applies any NVTs that discover operating system types and/or hardware device types.
     No vulnerability tests are executed. The main result is an overview on the found
     operating system and devices.
</li>

<li> New pre-configure Scan Configuration "Discovery". This Scan Configuration applies
     any NVTs that discover as many details about the target system, installed services
     and applications, as possible. No vulnerability tests are executed.
</li>

<li> Tasks: New class "Alterable Task" allows to change Target and Scan Config even if
     there are already reports for this task. This allows to have a playground task not
     designed to grant consistency between its reports.
</li>

<li> Problems with DNS resolving during scan: Each failed resolving of a target system
     name is now listed in section "Errors" of the report browser.
</li>

<li> The Scanner preference "silent_dependencies" was removed. It was reducing the number
     of reported results to only those NVTs that were explicitly selected. This is not
     necessary anymore because the filtering can now take care of reducing results.
     Furthermore, incomplete reports without log information do not offer adequate transparency.
     <br/>
     In case you applied Scan Configurations that were using this preference, you will get
     more (all) results now in new reports.
     <br/>
     Note that when using one of the pre-defined Scan Configurations you will see no changes
     because these were explicitly selecting all the NVTs.
</li>

<li> The Scanner preference "host_expansion" was removed. Its purpose was to automatically
     expand the target hosts. This functionality should not be done by a Scanner, especially
     because it can lead to unforeseeable expansions.
     <br/>
     Using one of the pre-defined Scan Configurations or derived ones, no changes of the
     behavior will happen.
</li>

<li> The Scanner will not create explicit results for detected ports anymore. These results
     had no reference to NVTs and were redundant anyway. An overview on the detected ports
     is already provided by other NVTs as log information. Additionally the new user interface
     even offers a explicit tabular overview in identified ports as part of the new report browser.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Vulnerability Management:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Severity replaces Threat: The concept of Threat Classes is extended to the Severity
     concept where the severity is not just a class but also contains a specific CVSS value.
     The CVSS value of a Severity is always the highest occurring CVSS value in the
     corresponding scan results. This allows a higher granularity in the view and for example
     improves sorting.
     <br/>
     This means comprehensive changes for the whole application:

     <ul>
     <li> Task Overview: In the past only the Threat level was stored for Tasks. Because old tasks
          covered results with only threat level and no CVSS level, the migration will use old
          rules of attaching a threat level
          and therefore insert the maximum of the respective level. This means that the Severity
          may show a higher CVSS value than the highest value actually present in the results.
          But this guarantees that the threat level will remain the same. The following values
          are therefore applied during the migration: High: 10.0, Medium: 5.0, Low: 2.0. Of course
          for new scans the exact values as occurring in the results are applied.
     </li>
     <li> Task-Details: For the list of reports of a task the very same changes and migration rule
          are applied as for the Task Overview.
     </li>
     <li> Notes: The distinction of High, Medium, Low is dropped and the migration will place all
          results into one class. This prevents notes from becoming invisble when NVTs are updated.
     </li>
     <li> Overrides: The distinction of High, Medium, Low is dropped and the migration will place
          all results into one class. This prevents overrides from becoming invisible when NVTs are updated.
     </li>
     <li> Furthermore, the New Severity is not anymore just a threat level but rather a CVSS value.
          Old overrides with just threat level are migrated with the same scheme as the Tasks
          and Reports (see above).
     </li>
     </ul>
</li>

<li> Tags: The new configuration object class "Tag" allows to attach short texts to almost any
     other object. These texts are available to filtering and are included in export files.
     This enables the user to create thematic groups or attach arbitrary attributes to objects.
</li>

<li> Reports: Under menu "Scan Management" there is now an overview on any available scan report,
     regardless of the relation to a task. The powerfilter is available here as well.
     <br/>
     This new view replaces the report list in the task details dialog. Suitable filters are
     set automatically.
</li>

<li> Search interface for all objects of the SecInfo Management: Via new menu item "All SecInfo"
     it is possible to search for keywords and with other methods of the Powerfilter through
     almost 300.000 objects of various types.
</li>

<li> Web interface is extended with multi-lingual support and translated into German language.
</li>

<li> Support for alternative faces of the web interface has been added, incuding a sample
     one in German (IT Schwachstellenampel).
</li>

<li> Integrated online CVSS calculator: Under menu "Extras/CVSS Calculator" a form is available
     that supports calculating a CVSS value.
</li>

<li> Reports: The browser for the report view was entirely reworked and split up into multiple
     sections, each with a page of its own. Many changes and extensions were applied.
     <br/>
     Attention: The changes are significant regarding the default view and regarding the powerfilter.
     Older stored powerfilters for reports may not work anymore and need to be recreated.
</li>

<li> Reports: Users can now individually configure the severity class ranges (High, Medium, Low)
     for the results view.
     <br/>
     Attention: The predefined class range is now the one of NIST. Therefore the colors in the
     view can change for old results and filters may return different results. If you want to
     switch back to the old behavior, just enter "My Settings" and select "OpenVAS Classic" for
     severity classes.
</li>

<li> Powerfilter: The powerfilter now offers a expand/collapse functionality in order to offer
     a regular dialog that is equivalent to the content of the filter string. Dialog and filter string
     are automatically mutually synchronized.
</li>

<li> Target: It is now possible to reduce the selected range of target systems via some rules.
     This includes an exclude list, reduction of double entries via Reverse Lookup and making
     Reverse Lookup obligatory.
</li>

<li> Host access rules: More opportunities to deny or allow scan of host for each user, for example
     hostnames, can now also be applied.
</li>

<li> Interface access rules: This new feature allows on the one hand to specify a special
     interface (like "eth1") for each task. On the other hand it is possible to express rules to
     allow or deny access to interfaces for each user.
</li>

<li> Reports: The port information is now extended with the current IANA service name that is
     registered for this port.
</li>

<li> New predefined Report Format Plugin "CSV Results": Comma-separated text table of
     single results.
</li>

<li> New pre-defined Report Format Plugin "CSV Hosts": Comma-separated text table of result
     overview for each target system.
</li>

<li> Tasks: It is now possible to configure the order in which the target hosts are scanned:
     Sequential (like before), reverse and random.
</li>

<li> Task Details: The list of reports is now handled via the new object management.
     This also adds the powerfilter to this page.
</li>

<li> Notes/Overrides: The actual note text is now used as identifier in the list instead
     of the NVT name.
</li>

<li> Web-GUI: Consistent access to object details always via identifier in first column.
     The redundant button for Details is therefore removed from the set of Actions.
</li>

<li> OVAL Definitions: The overview as well as the details dialog for OVAL Definitions has been reworked.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Protocols:
</p>

<ul>
<li> OMP now in version 5.0
</li>

<li> OAP dropped. Most functionality moved to OMP.
</li>

<li> User management is made available via OMP.
</li>

<li> Feed management is made available via OMP.
</li>

<li> OTP has been cut down to essentials. This was a first step
     towards replacing OTP by a superior protocol "OSP" eventually.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Architecture:
</p>

<ul>
<li> OpenVAS Administrator was dropped. Most functionality went into OpenVAS Manager.
</li>

<li> No support for Greenbone Security Desktop anymore.
</li>

<li> OpenVAS Scanner and OpenVAS Manager react on SIGHUP with reloading configs.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>April 17th, 2013 - OpenVAS-6 released: Integrated security information and integration with security tool chain</h3>

<p>
In keeping with the annual release cycle, the new generation of OpenVAS
[1] has been released. The open framework for vulnerability scanning and
management, OpenVAS-6 introduces a comprehensively extended and improved
feature set. Main advances/improvements were under taken in three domains:
1. improvements to the user interface for power users as well as for
beginners, 2. comprehensive integration of international and regional
security information and 3. integration with the security tool chain.
</p>

<p>
Highlights of this new release are the power filter concept and security
information management. The latter integrates not only official cross
reference of SCAP data right into scan results; with integrating security
data of a major German computer emergency response team, DFN-CERT [2], it
also adds analysis and reporting capabilities considering regional language
and a regional security focus. Improved scan capabilities, password
policies, a scan wizard and various other elements round up the new
additions into this new generation of OpenVAS. Special attention was given
to the integration with the security tool chain via a plugin for the system
monitoring family around Nagios [3] and a connector for integrating with
the information security management system (ISMS) verinice.PRO [4].
</p>

<p>
All in all 15 new features were added, accompanied with countless
improvements. The systematic improvements and reliable release of one major
update every twelve months once again underline the position of OpenVAS as
the most advanced Open Source solution for vulnerability management. The
new version can be downloaded free and is available as Free Software under
the GNU GPL license.
</p>

<p>
The company Greenbone Networks [5] develops and uses OpenVAS as a basis for
its appliance product family for vulnerability scanning and management.
Together with the companies SecPod [6], SecuritySpace [7] and the wider
community, new vulnerability tests and feature improvements are developed
on a daily basis. The German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI)
[8] supports and utilizes OpenVAS, together with many other federal
agencies, as part of their IT security framework.
</p>

<p>
OpenVAS-6 can be experienced live at the Linuxtag Conference and Exhibition
in Berlin (Germany) [9] from 22nd to 25th of May 2013 at the BSI booth.
</p>

<p>
New features:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Powerfilters: These allow filtering and sorting across various
     objects, can be stored, managed and reused. Also, default powerfilters can be
     configured.
</li>
<li> Management for Tasks, Note, Overrides, all of SecInfo Management
    and all of Configuration:
    The new object management offers consistently browsing, the powerfilter,
    cloning and export. Also the "New/Import" elements are now pages of their
    own.
</li>
<li> Auto-FP feature for trusted vendor updates.
</li>
<li> Multiple alerts per task.
</li>
<li> Wizard framework with quick start wizard.
</li>
<li> SecInfo Management a menu of its own.
</li>
<li> CPE, CVE and NVTs now offer full search and browsing.
</li>
<li> OVAL information in SecInfo Manegement.
</li>
<li> DFN-CERT information in SecInfo Management.
  These information are in german from a german CERT. It is a sample
  on how regional CERT information can be integrated. Further may follow
  upon interest.
</li>
<li> Synchronisation of SCAP/CERT data can be triggered from the web
  interface.
</li>
<li> Support for ISMS tool "verinice" with Report Format Plugins and
  Alert for verinice.PRO.
</li>
<li> Alert for sending results to a verinice .PRO server.
</li>
<li> Password policies for OpenVAS user accounts.
</li>
<li> CLI: OMP based Nagios plugin.
</li>
<li> CLI: (Sample) ncurses based OMP interface.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Improved features:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Date selection for schedules.
</li>
<li> Powerfilters can now be attached to Alerts.
</li>
<li> Now handles daylight saving in schedules.
</li>
<li> When importing a report, now the host details are also imported.
</li>
<li> Added switch to control whether a task should contribute to asset
  management.
</li>
<li> Report exports now also contain the family of NVTs.
</li>
<li> Faster report format plugins LaTeX and PDF.
</li>
<li> Manager: Serves OMP even when the OpenVAS Scanner is down.
</li>
<li> Manager: Can now handle a second OMP address.
</li>
<li> Scanner: Optional OTP version 1.1 which is like 1.0 but sends less
  info to the client initially.
</li>
<li> Scanner: Command line switch "--only-cache" to just build the cache
  and exit.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Changed features:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Renamed "Escalator" to "Alert".
</li>
<li> The ARF report format plugin is now a pre-defined format.
</li>
<li> Various performance improvements.
</li>
<li> Out-of-source builds for all modules supported and recommended.
</li>
<li> For all modules, -Werr has been moved from Release to Debug when building.
</li>
<li> The minimum required version of GNUTLS is now 2.8.
</li>
<li> Scanner: Removed built-in logfile rotation. The system environment
  technology for logrotate should be used instead.
</li>
<li>Scanner: The magic that NVTs of category ACT_SETTINGS were
  always enabled even when user disabled them has been removed. OTP clients
  now have to take care to enable as needed.* Changed behaviour of NVT sync script "openvas-nvt-sync":
  It will now delete scripts not part of the when using rsync,
  except for the directory "private/".
  A Migration option "--migrate-to-private" of the sync-script will
  move private scripts into the "private/" directory.
  The Feed Sync will stop with an error until the "private/" is created.
  As soon as this directory is created, the synchronisation will ultimately
  delete all files in the local feed directory that are not part of the
  regular Feed.
</li>
<li> Scanner: Newlines in script tags are now escaped.
</li>
<li> Scanner: The size of tags is not limited anymore.
</li>
<li> Scanner: Internal use of NVTI references by OID to allow using the NVTI
  cache properly. This significantly lowers the memory consumption
  per Scanner process.
</li>

<h3>August 23rd, 2012 - OpenVAS becomes OVAL Adopter</h3>

<p>
Issued as an OVAL System
Characteristics Provider OpenVAS helps to automize excessive
OVAL-based scanning without overloading the scanned hosts.
Whoever works with OVAL scanning and likely faced the problem to collect
the necessary system characteristics remotely across
networks, should give OpenVAS a try.
</p>

<p>
This functionality was originally developed for the Greenbone Security Manager
by Greenbone Networks, but downloadable sample Scan Configurations and Report
Format Plugins are usable with OpenVAS as well. The upcoming support for Windows
Operating Systems will support MITRE OVAL Repository
(http://oval.mitre.org/repository) and of SecPod SCAP Repository
(http://www.scaprepo.com).
</p>

<p>
Further links on OpenVAS OVAL Adoption are collected here:
<a href="http://www.openvas.org/software.html#standards_and_interoperability">http://www.openvas.org/software.html#standards_and_interoperability</a>
</p>

<p>
About OVAL and OVAL-SC
</p>

<p>
The Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL) is an approach for a
standardized description of the (security) state of an IT system.
OVAL files describe a vulnerability and define tests to identify the state
in which a system is vulnerable. They usually refer to specific version of
software products for which a known vulnerability exists.
</p>

<p>
This means that in order to check for vulnerabilities described in an OVAL
definition, information about the current state of the system is needed.
This information is collected in a standardized format as well -- the OVAL
System Characteristics (SC).
</p>

<p>
There are a number of solutions which perform checks based on OVAL definitions
and SC files. OVAL definitions are provided by various vendors. MITRE provides
the OVAL Repository with more than 10,000 entries, SecPod has more than 21,000
entries.

<h3>May 10th, 2012 - OpenVAS-5 released: New Asset-Management, Delta-Reports and embedded SCAP-Data</h3>

<p>
One year after OpenVAS-4 the fifth version of the tool for vulnerability
scanning and management offers several new features. At the same time the
number of freely available vulnerability checks has increased to over 25,000.
</p>

<p>
A very practical extension is the possibility to show the differences between
two scan reports and the direct availability of current CPE and CVE information
inside the OpenVAS database.  This saves time for users who are finding out
about changes and security recommendations. The new asset management adds a
second view on scan results. It allows the user to review scan results for any
selection of IP devices in the network.
</p>

<p>
All in all 20 new features were added, especially focusing on simplifying daily
use. The systemtic improvements underline the position of OpenVAS as the most
advanced Open Source solution for vulnerability management. The new version can
be downloaded free and is available as Free Software under the GNU GPL license.
</p>

<p>
The company Greenbone Networks develops and uses OpenVAS as a basis for its
appliance product family for vulnerability scanning and management. Together
with the companies SecPod, SecuritySpace and the wider community new
vulnerability  tests and feature improvements are developed on a daily basis.
The German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) supports OpenVAS and
uses it, together with many other federal agencies, for their IT security
framework.
</p>

<p>
OpenVAS-5 can be experienced live at the Linuxtag Conference and Exhibition in
Berlin (Germany)  from 23rd to 26th of May 2012 at the BSI booth.
</p>

<p>
New features:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Delta reports to analyse differences between two scans.
<li> Security Information Database: Integrated SCAP data (CPE, CVE) including
  update method via feed service.
<li> Integrated Asset Management.
<li> Configuration object 'Port Lists' for transparent TCP/UDP port ranges.
<li> Prognostic scans based on asset data and current SCAP data.
<li> Support for individual time zones for users.
<li> Support for obeservers (granting read-only access)
<li> Support for notes/overrides lifetimes.
<li> Trashcan for collecting removed items before ultimate deletion.
<li> Container tasks for importing reports.
<li> SSH port for Local Security Checks configurable.
<li> Product detections as reported by Scanner are handled to allow detailed
  cross-referenced detection information.
<li> Support for sorting results by CVSS score.
<li> Support for importing results sent through the XML escalator.
<li> Support for escalating result to a Sourcefire Defense Center.
<li> Support for using an SSH key pair for SSH authentication.
<li> Individual user settings, starting with time zone.
<li> Display single result details.
<li> Icon indicators for detected operating systems.
<li> LDAP per-user authentication method.
</ul>

<p>
Improved features:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Updated builtin Report Format Plugins HTML, Text and LaTeX/PDF to reflect
  various new features that are already present in GSA, including delta and
  prognostic reports. 
<li> Product detection information in results XML.
<li> Performance for massiv scanner results by using transaction groups.
<li> Import of Target lists to allow comma-separated, line-by-line lists.
<li> Support for large database files on 32-bit platforms.
</ul>

<p>
Changed features:
</p>

<ul>
<li> The user interface design of the web interface has been updated.
<li> Report format signatures no longer contain user editable fields.
  Thus, users can change comments without loosing validity of plugins.
<li> The max_host and max_checks scan performance parameters have been moved from
  scan configs to tasks.
<li> Security: Enforces strict permissions on sensitive OpenVAS Manager files.
<li> Security: Drop privileges before executing report format plugins if running with
  elevated privileges.

<h3>January 5th, 2012 - OpenVAS-5 BETA-Test phase started</h3>

<p>
The OpenVAS developers are proud to announce that the test phase for the
upcoming OpenVAS-5 started and the first releases have become available.
</p>

<p>
OpenVAS-5 is yet another major evolution step of the Open Vulnerability
Assessment System. Advances range from integration of CVE and CPE databse,
an Asset Management over vulnerability prognosis, a improved user interface
and not at least improved scanning and detection capabilities.
</p>

<p>
The OpenVAS-5-based Greenbone Security Manager recently passed the SCAP
validation of US agency NIST for category Unauthenticated Scanner.
All required criteria were added to OpenVAS-5.
</p>

<p>
A few features are still in the works and will be added over the next
couple of weeks during the Beta phase. Together with improvements based
on user feedback.
</p>

<p>
It is planned to close beta phase in february, entering the release
candidate phase. The aim is to release OpenVAS-5 in march, exactly
one year after the release of OpenVAS-4.

<h3>March 17th, 2011 - OpenVAS-4 released</h3>

<p>
The OpenVAS community is proud to announce the availability
of OpenVAS-4, the next generation of the Open Vulnerability
Assessment System. Though only eight months since OpenVAS 3.1,
the new release represents the biggest step forward ever
in the history of OpenVAS.
</p>

<p>
The most significant new features are a Report Format Plugin
Framework, a Master-Slave mode and an improved Scanner.
The extended OpenVAS Management Protocol (OMP) 2.0 of
OpenVAS Manager makes several new features consistently
available to all of its clients (Web, Desktop, CLI).
</p>

<p>
This is the first release that is directly accompanied
with installation packages for over 20 platforms,
several installation quick guides, a tool to check proper setup
and, last but not least a virtual appliance.
</p>

<p>
OpenVAS-4 covers the following OpenVAS modules:
Libraries 4.0, Scanner 3.2, Manager 2.0,
Administrator 1.1, GSA 2.0, GSD 1.1 and CLI 1.1.
</p>

<p>
At the OpenVAS developer conference #3, July 7-9 in Osnabrück, Germany,
the feature set for OpenVAS-5 will take shape.
</p>

<p>
Availability:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> Source Code downloads are directly available from OpenVAS homepage: http://www.openvas.org</p></li>
<li><p> Binary installation packages: http://www.openvas.org/install-packages.html</p></li>
<li><p> Virtual Appliance: http://www.openvas.org/vm.htm</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
New features and changes:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
  New: Report Format plugin framework. All previous reporting features were converted
  to plugins. The XML representation of a report is now the base for any plugin
  and thus consistency of reports is gained.
  </p>

  <p>
  Report Format Plugins can be set active so that they appear in the selection
  lists. Selections can consider content types so that for example only the
  plugins with content type "text" are offered as email body.
  </p>

  <p>
  It is possible to use parameters for the plugins so the user can adjust the
  behaviour of the Report Format to the individual preferences or needs.
  </p>

  <p>
  A verification method allows to distribute signatures for valid plugins via
  the NVT Feed.
  </p>
</li>

<li><p> New default Report Format: TXT for simple text. </p></li>

<li><p> New default Report Format: LaTeX for LaTeX source. </p></li>

<li><p> New sample Report Format: Simple Bar Chart.
  Demonstrates how to use Gnuplot for graphical reports. </p></li>

<li><p> New sample Report Format: Simple Topo Plot.
  Demonstrates how to use Graphviz for graphical reports. </p></li>

<li><p> New sample Report Format: Simple Pie Chart.
  Demonstrates how to use PyChart for graphical reports. </p></li>

<li><p> New sample Report Format: Simple Map Plot.
  Demonstrates how to use MapServer and GDAL for graphical reports. </p></li>

<li><p> New sample Report Format: Sourcefire Host Input.
  Demonstrates that Report Formats can be used to build connectors. </p></li>

<li> <p> New: Master-Slave mode. Any OpenVAS Manager can use one or many other OpenVAS
  Manager as slave to run scans. The whole scan task is transferred to the
  slave, results are continuously reported to the Master during scan process.
  After the scan is finished all data is removed from the slave.
  </p>

  <p>
  The master can also retrieve system reports from the slave and thus can
  collect the performance overview for all configured slaves.
  </p>
</li>

<li> <p> New Escalator: HTTP GET. This allows for example to access text message (SMS)
  gateways or ticket management systems. </p></li>

<li><p> Extended Escalator: For email escalation it is now possible
  to select from configured Report Formats to be included in the email body.</li></p>

<li><p> Agents: A verification method was added. This allows to distribute signatures
  for valid agents via the NVT Feed.</li></p>

<li><p> Credentials: Can now be edited. This allows to change the login name or
  password without the need to create a new scan configuration. </p></li>

<li><p> Credentials: Auto-generated installer packages are now created on the fly. If
  the generators are improved, it is now easy to create an updated package for
  already existing credentials. </p></li>

<li><p> Targets: Credentials for SMB and SSH are now distinguished. </p></li>

<li><p> Targets: Various opportunities have been added to specify and combine IP
  ranges and ports. </p></li>

<li><p> Tasks: The task overview is delivered much faster now. </p></li>

<li><p> Reports: The report filtering is much faster now. </p></li>

<li><p> Performance: A fall-back performance report delivers some base
        data if no other tool is configured. </p></li>

<li><p> Web interface: Changed login mechanism from HTTP BasicAuth to session
        based authentication. </p></li>

<li><p> Scan behaviour: By default now only ports are scanned that are specified
        as part of the target. </p></li>

<li><p> No binary NVTs: The remaining binary NVTs are turned into built-in functionality.
        Binary plugins are (finally) no more supported by OpenVAS. </p></li>

<li><p> Network scan NVTs: Network-wide initial scans now posible. </p></li>

<li><p> Scan performance increased: Lower memory footprint (~10% more concurrent
        scans possible) </p></li>

<li><p> Scan Feature for VHosts: Preferences allow to specify VHosts. </p></li>

<li><p> Scanner: Command line options "--dump-cfg" and "--gen-config" are removed. </p></li>

<li><p> Scanner: Configuration file "openvassd.conf" not mandatory anymore. </p></li>

<li><p> Helper tool openvas-mkcert: New switches and does not create openvassd.conf. </p></li>

<li><p> OpenVAS is now compliant with the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS 2.3). </p></li>

<li><p> Consolidated default ports: Manager listens on 9390, Scanner on 9391, GSA on 9392 and
        Administrator on 9393.</p></li>

<li><p> OpenVAS build environment now consistently uses cmake and pkgconfig across all modules. </p></li>

<li><p> Compile-time hardening flags are now enabled by default across all modules. </p></li>

<li><p> All applications now consistently deliver output of --version compliant
        with the GNU Coding Standard.

<li><p> OMP self-documentation: Part of the Managers' XML-based communication protocol
        OMP 2.0 is to deliver the full specification and documentation of the
        protocol itself (command "HELP"). It can be retrieved as XML-,
        RNC- or HTML representation. See here for online documentation:
        http://www.openvas.org/omp-2-0.html
</p></li>

<li><p> OAP self-documentation: Part of the Administrators' XML-based communication protocol
        OAP 1.0 is to deliver the full specification and documentation of the
        protocol itself (command "HELP"). It can be retrieved as XML-,
        RNC- or HTML representation. See here for online documentation:
        http://www.openvas.org/oap-1-0.html
</p></li>

<li><p> Extended Language Support: Dekstop client GSD now supports english, german and french.
</p></li>

</ul>

<p>
Compatibility and migration:
</p>

<ul>

<li><p> The OpenVAS NVT Feed will be extended with tests that take
     advantage of the network scan feature but fully keeps the
     behaviour for previous releases. Also the replacement methods
     for the former binary NVTs are compatible across OpenVAS 2
     through 4.
</p></li>

<li><p> The OpenVAS Manager has a migration option for updating
     an OpenVAS Manager 1.0 SQL database. But there is no support
     to downgrade the database back to 1.0.
</p></li>

<li><p> Migration from OpenVAS 2.x/3.x: Several default file
     locations changed for the new OpenVAS Scanner.
     Installing OpenVAS-4 "ontop" of an older release will likely
     cause trouble because the old, and now only optional "openvassd.conf"
     forces wrong paths. Delete or move away that file before starting with OpenVAS-4.
</p></li>

<li><p> OpenVAS Scanner communication protocol (OTP) remains compatible with the previous release,
     so the latest release of the old OpenVAS-Client still works.
</p></li>

</ul>

<h3>December 7th, 2010 - OpenVAS Administrator 1.0.0 released</h3>

<p>
OpenVAS Administrator 1.0 now available

<h3>August 3rd, 2010 - OpenVAS CLI 1.0 Released</h3>

<p>
OpenVAS CLI 1.0: Full command line client for OpenVAS Manager 1.0 now available 
</p>

<p>
The OpenVAS CLI package contains the command line tool "omp" which allows to send any
command of the OpenVAS Management Protocol (OMP) in original form and some of
the commands as short cuts.  This allows to create batch processes for remote
control of OpenVAS.
</p>

<h3>August 2nd, 2010 - Greenbone Security Assistant 1.0 Released</h3>

<p>
Greenbone Security Assistant (GSA) 1.0: Full web-client for OpenVAS Manager 1.0 now available
</p>

<p>
GSA 1.0 represents almost 2 years of intensive work. The mission of GSA is to be
a web client to the OpenVAS Manager 1.0 via the OpenVAS Management Protocol (OMP).
</p>

<p>
GSA offers a complete implementation of OMP in order to access all features
to organize and manage OpenVAS vulnerability scans. Additionally, GSA
optionally acts as a client for the upcoming openvas-administrator using the
OpenVAS Administration Protocol (OAP) which allows e.g. management of scan users.
</p>

<p>
Central features of Greenbone Security Assistant are:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Full OMP 1.0 client. The XML-based OMP responses are transformed into
  web pages via XSLT.
</li>

<li> No additional web-server required. The GSA daemon (gsad) uses microhttpd
  to implement a HTTP service on its own.
</li>

<li> Plain HTML. Neither cookies, JavaScript nor other dynamic elements are used.
  GSA works stateless and uses HTTP Basic Auth.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>July 29th, 2010 - OpenVAS Manager 1.0 Released</h3>

<p>
Substantial Technology Advance: Vulnerability Management with OpenVAS Manager 1.0
</p>

<p>
OpenVAS Manager 1.0 represents almost 2 years of intensive work.  The mission of
OpenVAS Manager is to offer powerful and comfortable vulnerability management on
top of the actual vulnerability scanner, OpenVAS Scanner 3.1.
</p>

<p>
The OpenVAS Manager is a layer between the OpenVAS Scanner and various client
applications. The upcoming clients cover web, desktop and command line
technology and will replace the classic OpenVAS Client.
</p>

<p>
Central features of OpenVAS Manager are:
</p>

<ul>
<li> New XML-based protocol OMP (OpenVAS Management Protocol) which client tools
  use to control scans, results, etc.
</li>

<li> SQL database where configurations, scan results etc. are stored. Thus, clients
  do not need to keep local storage anymore.
</li>

<li> Full control of scan processes. This includes multiple concurrent scans as
  well as stopping, pausing, resuming and not at least the scheduling of scans.
</li>

<li> Management of scan notes, false positives and result escalators (notification
  on finished scans).
</li>
</ul>

<h3>July 14th, 2010 - OpenVAS Scanner 3.1 Released</h3>

<p>
The OpenVAS developers are happy to announce the release of openvas-scanner 
3.1.0. This release adds a number of new features, for example support for 
soft pausing of scans, for retrieving the version of an installed NVT 
collection, for automatically installing generated client certificates, for 
storing uploaded preference files in memory, for dropping privileges for NASL 
and NES NVTs and for scanning virtual web hosts. It also contains updated 
feed synchronization scripts and removes legacy support for passwords stored 
in plaintext (see <a href="http://www.openvas.org/openvas-cr-31.html">OpenVAS change request #31</a>). 
</p>


<h3>March 12th, 2010 - The OpenVAS Project applies for the Google Summer of Code 2010 Program</h3>

<p>
The OpenVAS Project sent in its application for the
<a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/program/home/google/gsoc2010">Google Summer of Code 2010
Program</a> today.</p>

<p>A list of accepted organizations will be published on March 18th.

<h3>December 18th, 2009 - Network Security Scanner OpenVAS 3.0.0 Released</h3>

<p>
On December 18th, 2009, the OpenVAS developer team released OpenVAS 3.0.0.  The
release introduces new features and a new architecture which forms the basis for
turning the vulnerability scanner into a vulnerability management solution.
</p>

<p>
The GPL-licensed Open Vulnerability Assessment System (OpenVAS) has become
<i>the</i> Open Source Network Vulnerability Scanner. It is complemented with the largest
open collection of vulnerability tests, the daily updated OpenVAS NVT Feed with over
15,500 Network Vulnerability Tests (NVTs).
</p>

<p>
Exactly 1 year after version 2.0.0 was released, the new 3.0 generation
introduces:
<ul>
<li>A new internal architecture of the modules
<li>NVT Meta Information that is free of arbitrary size limits
<li>IPv6 support
<li>WMI clients support
<li>Supports upcoming optional extensions:
<ul>
   <li>OpenVAS Manager for storing and organizing scans on a central server in a
       SQL database
   <li>OpenVAS Administrator for User-, Feed- and Settings-Management
   <li>Greenbone Security Assistent for a web-based Vulnerability Management
</ul>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>Compatibility:</b><br>
The new OpenVAS Scanner remains compatible with the OpenVAS NVT Feed as well as
with the Greenbone Security Feed. Also, it is possible to use the new OpenVAS
Scanner with the OpenVAS-Client 2.0.
OpenVAS Client 3.0 can connect to both OpenVAS Scanner 3.0 and OpenVAS Server
2.0 concurrently, and even to OpenVAS Manager via the new OpenVAS Management
Protocol (OMP).
</p>

<p>
<b>New Module Architecture:</b><br>
OpenVAS 3.0 introduces a new architecture where openvas-libraries now includes
openvas-libnasl as well as redundant code from openvas-client.  The module
openvas-server has been renamed to openvas-scanner and includes any
platform-dependent elements of openvas-plugins. As a result of this, the total
number of source code lines decreased, though new features were added.  Also,
for running just the core scanner only 2 modules are required (instead of 4 as
is the case for OpenVAS 2.0).
</p>

<p>
<b>Maintenance:</b><br>
Version 3.0 will be maintained by the OpenVAS team for at least 2 years and the
maintenance of Version 2.0 will continue for at least one year.  Version 1.0 is
being retired in January 2010.
</p>

<p>
<b>Downloads:</b><br>
All download links for OpenVAS 3.0.0 and additional information can be found on
the OpenVAS website. OpenVAS 3.0.0 has been released initially as a source code
package; binary packages for various distributions are expected to follow.
</p>

<p>
The OpenVAS team would like to thank everybody who has contributed to this
release. We have worked hard to bring you a reliable network security scanner.
If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to use the public
mailing list and our online chat. Please use the <a

<h3>April 9th, 2009 - OpenVAS now beyond 10000 Network Vulnerability Tests</h3>

<p>
Passing the 10000th Network Vulnerability Test (NVT) is a perfect
occasion to report about the progress of the OpenVAS project[1].
</p>

<p>
In October 2008 the systematic development of new NVTs
started with a base of around 5800 Tests. With the release
of OpenVAS 2.0 in December 2008, the development was boosted
and has now reached an average of 10 code updates per day.
The public OpenVAS NVT Feed Service delivers 3-10 new vulnerability
tests every day.

</p>

<h3>December 5th, 2008 - OpenVAS 2.0-rc1 released</h3>

<p>
The OpenVAS developers are happy to announce the release of the 2.0-rc1
versions of openvas-libraries, openvas-libnasl, openvas-server and
openvas-client.
</p>

<p>
This release is the first release candidate for the upcoming 2.0 release of
OpenVAS. Unless serious bugs are discovered, this release candidate will become
the final OpenVAS 2.0 release. Users are encouraged to test this release and to
report bugs to the OpenVAS bug tracker located at http://bugs.openvas.org/ .
</p>

<p>
This release marks another milestone towards the improvement of the OpenVAS
infrastructure; it uses the finalized version of OTP, the new OpenVAS Transport
Protocol which debuted in 2.0-beta1 and has now completely replaced the old
Nessus Transport Protocol (NTP).
</p>

<h3>November 14th, 2008 - OpenVAS and backtrack</h3>

<p>As OpenVAS is not in Backtrack 3 by default (yet!). You can download lzm module 
or download remastered backtrack3 which includes OpenVAS lzm (it still fits on 700 Mb CD). It's good way of testing OpenVAS in case you want to try it out. </p>

<h3>October 30th, 2008 - 2008 OpenVAS Contest Winners Announced</h3>

<p>
With 5 nominees who contributed a large number of improvements to the OpenVAS
framework and extended the Open Source Network Vulnerability Testing, the
2008 OpenVAS Contest was a great success.
</p>

<p>
The OpenVAS developers and the sponsors of the OpenVAS Contest would like to
thank all developers for their great contributions. The developers have spent a
considerable amount of time on their submissions and have helped OpenVAS to
become even better. These contributions will be included in the upcoming OpenVAS
2.0 release which will help to make the task of network security scanning easier
worldwide.

<h3>October 15th, 2008 - OpenVAS 2.0 Begins Public Beta Phase</h3>

<p>
In late September 2008, the OpenVAS developer team released the 2.0-beta1
version of OpenVAS, the Open Vulnerability Assessment System for network
security scanning.<br>
The intended audience for this beta release are experienced users interested 
in upcoming features as well as developers of vulnerability checks.
</p>

<p>
The new version introduces first steps towards support for OVAL, the <a 
href="http://oval.mitre.org">Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language</a>.
OVAL is an international, information security, community standard to promote
open, standardized and publicly available security content.<br>
The OpenVAS server can now execute OVAL files just like its own Network
Vulnerability Tests (NVTs) by using the OVAL definitions interpreter "ovaldi".
While the plain ovaldi tool can only check local systems where it is 
installed, the combination with OpenVAS enables it to test any target system
for which OpenVAS has collected information. The beta1 release offers sample
support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux security announcements which are
provided as OVAL definitions.
</p>

<p>
Major internal changes include the cleaned and extended protocol for
client-server communication (OTP) and the transition to the new OID-based
scheme for unique IDs of vulnerability tests. The switch from the NTP
inherited from Nessus to OTP was necessary due to security and design
considerations.
</p>

<p>
The OpenVAS (NVTs) remain compatible with both the 1.0 and 2.0 series of
OpenVAS. This also means that the free OpenVAS NVT feed service (which has
recently extended to deliver the full range of NVTs, grown to over 5000
available NVTs) is also compatible for both release series. The switch from NTP
to OTP does not affect NVTs already in existance. This means NVTs written in
NASL continue to be fully supported by OpenVAS. There is no need to make changes
to your old NASL scripts -- unless you want to use the new features.
</p>

<p>
The first release candidate of the new OpenVAS Compendium has been made
available in PDF and HTML format for final reviews and as a base for translation
into other languages (a translation to German is already in progress) as well.
</p>

<p>
The OpenVAS team is looking forward to feedback for the beta1 release. If you
want to participate in the beta phase by sharing your experience with beta1 or
if you have any questions, please feel free to use the public mailing lists or
visit us in our <a href="http://www.openvas.org/online-chat.html">IRC online
chat</a>.

<h3>August 13th, 2008 - OpenVAS Toolchain for Network Vulnerability Tests
Established and Stable</h3>

<p>
<b>OpenVAS Toolchain for Network Vulnerability Tests Established and Stable,
Now Focussing on Tests Development and Documentation</b>
</p>

<p>
In July 2008 the OpenVAS developer team finished the update cycle of the 1.0
release including all four server modules and the client.
</p>

<p>
The most work during this update cycle went into cleanups and support for RPM
and Debian packagers.
The number of necessary bug-fixes remained pleasingly low.
</p>

<p>
OpenVAS installation packages are readily available for various platforms:
openSUSE, Fedora, Mandrake, FreeBSD and Gentoo. Packages for Debian and Ubuntu
are in the works. Additionally, OpenVAS-Client is available for Microsoft
Windows operating systems.
</p>

<p>
The OpenVAS developer team has started creating a comprehensive documentation
for the whole toolchain; the next major challenge for the project is now to
extend the range of the vulnerability tests for present and upcoming security
issues, especially for those reported as CVEs, BIDs etc.
</p>

<p>
It is a fundamental goal of the OpenVAS project team to accompany the Free
Software OpenVAS network security scanner licensed under GNU GPL with a feed of
vulnerability tests being Open Source and readily available for everyone as
well.
Additional contributors are welcome to join the OpenVAS developer team.
</p>
