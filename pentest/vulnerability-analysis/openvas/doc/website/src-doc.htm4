<h2>Source Code Documentation</h2>

<p>
The OpenVAS team uses <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/index.html">doxygen</a>
for source code documentation.
</p>

<p>
You can produce a full or alternatively a more concise documentation on your
own by using the "make doc-full" or "make doc" command in the module's build
directory.
</p>

<p>
Because of the size of the full documentation, the website offers only the
documentation of the most recent release for each module.
</p>
