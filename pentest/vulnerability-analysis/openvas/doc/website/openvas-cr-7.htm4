<h2>OpenVAS Change Request #7: Extend report widget with optional info on NVT name/oid in OpenVAS-Client</h2>

Status: Voted +2. Implemented. Released with OpenVAS-Client 1.0.4.

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>
To provide transparency on which parts of a report have been created by which
NVTs.
</p>

<h3>References</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://lists.wald.intevation.org/pipermail/openvas-devel/2008-April/000657.html">Initial proposal on openvas-devel mailing list</a>.
</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>
The report widget shows a collection of results as reported
for a host/port/severity combination. The texts are separated by a line
filled with "=".
</p>

<p>
However, it is not possible in the GUI to find out which of the text
blocks is created by which NVT.
But for diagnostics/debugging it would be helpful to know about
the respective NVTs easily. Of course the respective "report.nbe" file
contains the ID of the NVTs, and with this ID and the plugin cache the name
of the NVT could be retrieved, but this is regarded as not simple enough.
</p>

<h3>Effects</h3>

<ul>
<li> If the option is switched on to show the name and OID of the NVTs,
     then the report widget will consume two extra lines per report.
</ul>

<h3>Design and Implementation</h3>

<ul>
<li> In openvas-client/nessus/preferences.c:prefs_get_default() add
     handling of boolean option "show_nvt_name_and_oid".
     Note: the name is intentionally kept a bit more general, because
     the names may eventually be shown in other areas of GUI as well (e.g.
     the preferences). Maybe there are more places in this file
     that need to be adapted.
<li> In openvas-client/nessus/prefs_dialog/prefs_dialog_prefs.c
     add management for this new option.
<li> In openvas-client/nessus/prefs_dialog/prefs_report.c:row_activated()
     add a line with NVT name and OID (in brackets) and make it conditional
     to the option "show_nvt_name_and_oid".
</ul>
