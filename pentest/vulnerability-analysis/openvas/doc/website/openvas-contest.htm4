<h2>Contest: Best Advances for OpenVAS Network Vulnerability Tests</h2>

<p>
The OpenVAS Team calls for submission of patches, scripts, converters
or anything else that significantly improves the OpenVAS framework
and extends Open Source Network Vulnerability Testing.
</p>

<p>
You are free to choose the area of improvements, examples are:
<ul>
<li>New .nasl scripts for recent security alerts</li>
<li>NASL libraries for simplifying development of new test scripts</li>
<li>Converter routines that (semi-)automatically create NASL scripts from formal
security alerts.</li>
<li>Performance improvements for the current tests.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
There are many other ways to extend and improve the OpenVAS framework.
The only hard requirement is that your solution is published as Free Software
under GNU GPLv2+.
</p>

<p>
The following rewards have already been offered by the contest sponsors:
<ul>
<li>1st place: 600 Euro</li>
<li>2nd place: 300 Euro</li>
<li>3rd place: 200 Euro</li>

<li>relevance of the covered alerts</li>
<li>sustainable future benefit (e.g. in the case of supporting APIs)</li>
<li>how well the development was coordinated via the public OpenVAS mailing
lists (teams may win as well)</li>
