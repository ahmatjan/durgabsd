<h2>How to use ovaldi with SLAD</h2>

<p>
  Starting with the 2-2.1 release, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ovaldi/">ovaldi</a>
  support is available in SLAD. This means that SLAD is able to use <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/">OVAL</a>
  definitions to identify security issues on the local systems. The ovaldi
  support in SLAD already includes a large number of OVAL definitions and
  requires no additional work beyond installing SLAD on the target host.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Important</b>: In the current version, SLAD will not automatically update
  the included OVAL definitions. This means that the ovaldi integrated in SLAD
  will miss security threats that have been discovered since the last SLAD
  release. Due to this limitation, it is not yet recommended for production use.
</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>
  To use ovaldi with SLAD you have to install SLAD on the target system. The
  easiest way to do this is to use SLADinstaller; information on installing and
  using SLADinstaller is available <a href="using-slad.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Once you have installed SLAD on the target machine, you can instruct the
  remote SLAD to run ovaldi by enabling the "Execute ovaldi for scanning OVAL
  described issues" option available in the preferences for the "SLAD run" NVT
  in OpenVAS-Client. This option is enabled by default. Execute the scan to
  start the SLAD run on the target machine.
</p>

<p>
  After you have started the scan, you can use the NVT "SLAD fetch results" to
  retrieve the results of the scan. Be aware that ovaldi usually takes slightly
  more time to complete than other plugins, so the ovaldi results might not be
  available when you run "SLAD fetch results" for the first time. In this case,
  simply wait a moment for ovaldi to finish. You can retrieve the SLAD status
  by running additional scans with "SLAD fetch results" enabled.
</p>

<p>
  The results of the ovaldi run will be displayed along with the results of
  the other SLAD plugins and other NVTs in OpenVAS-Client. If ovaldi was able to
  identify vulnerabilities on the target host, the output will look similar to
  this screenshot:
