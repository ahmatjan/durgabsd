<h2>OpenVAS Change Request #6: Remove support of old XML report format</h2>

Status: Voted +2. Implemented with SVN-884. Released with OpenVAS-Client 1.0.4.

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>
To reduce code base.
</p>

<p>
To prevent people from using a unsupported feature.
</p>

<h3>References</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://lists.wald.intevation.org/pipermail/openvas-devel/2008-February/000601.html">Survey whether anyone needs this format on openvas-devel mailing list</a>.
</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>
This feature was marked as deprecated already in the old Nessus times.
</p>

<p>
A successor XML format exists.
</p>

<p>
The DTD (nbe.dtd) for this format does not exist anyway
(or never has been made readily available).
</p>

<p>
Apart from this, there seem to be no OpenVAS users that
use the feature anymore (survey does not result a single answer).
</p>

<h3>Effects</h3>

<ul>
<li> It will not be possible anymore to create the old XML format
     via the OpenVAS-Client.
<li> People who still might have (automatic) processing chains
     based on the old format will have to stick to the latest
     OpenVAS-Client release that allowed to export this format.
</ul>

<h3>Design and Implementation</h3>

<ul>
<li> Remove nessus/xml_output.c and nessus/xml_output.h from openvas-client.
<li> Remove handling of old XML format in nessus/cli.c, nessus/Makefile,
     nessus/nessus.c, nessus/nmake.w32 and nessus/report_save.c.
<li> Remove text about "old-xml" from doc/OpenVAS-Client.1.
<li> Remove text abut the old xml from users-manual.lyx and users-manual-de.lyx
     in module openvas-manual.
</ul>
