<h3>April 2nd, 2015 - OpenVAS-8 released: Charts, Quality of Detection and PostgreSQL-Support</h3>

<p>
Following the annual release cycle, the new generation of OpenVAS [1] has been
released. The new version of the open framework for vulnerability scanning and
management, OpenVAS-8, introduces a comprehensively extended and improved
feature set. Advances and improvements were achieved in virtually all areas.
</p>

<p>
Highlights of this new release are the chart module for a variety of graphical
representation, the Quality of Detection (QoD) concept and the optional support
of PostgreSQL as database backend. Major advances were also achieved for the
access control management: more roles, group admins and super-admin to name just
a few. Notable as well is the introduction of the optional multi-scanner support
via the new protocol OSP (OpenVAS Scanner Protocol) for which a growing number
of servers is expected for the future. Last but not least, the OpenVAS Scanner
now requires less ressources and uses redis[2] for the inter-process communication.
</p>

<p>
All in all OpenVAS-8 ships 28 new and improved features, accompanied with
countless smaller changes. The systematic improvements and reliable release of
one major update every twelve months once again underlines the position of
OpenVAS as the most advanced Open Source solution for vulnerability management.
The new version can be downloaded free and is available as Free Software under
the GNU GPL license.
</p>

<p>
The company Greenbone Networks [3] develops and uses OpenVAS as a base for its
appliance product family for vulnerability scanning and management. Together
with the company SecPod [4] and the growing community, new vulnerability tests
and feature improvements are developed on a daily basis. The German Federal
Office for Information Security (BSI) [5] supports and utilizes OpenVAS,
together with many other federal agencies, as part of their IT security
framework.

<h3>April 17th, 2013 - OpenVAS-6 released: Integrated security information and integration with security tool chain</h3>

<p>
In keeping with the annual release cycle, the new generation of OpenVAS
[1] has been released. The open framework for vulnerability scanning and
management, OpenVAS-6 introduces a comprehensively extended and improved
feature set. Main advances/improvements were under taken in three domains:
1. improvements to the user interface for power users as well as for
beginners, 2. comprehensive integration of international and regional
security information and 3. integration with the security tool chain.
</p>

<p>
Highlights of this new release are the power filter concept and security
information management. The latter integrates not only official cross
reference of SCAP data right into scan results; with integrating security
data of a major German computer emergency response team, DFN-CERT [2], it
also adds analysis and reporting capabilities considering regional language
and a regional security focus. Improved scan capabilities, password
policies, a scan wizard and various other elements round up the new
additions into this new generation of OpenVAS. Special attention was given
to the integration with the security tool chain via a plugin for the system
monitoring family around Nagios [3] and a connector for integrating with
the information security management system (ISMS) verinice.PRO [4].
</p>

<p>
All in all 15 new features were added, accompanied with countless
improvements. The systematic improvements and reliable release of one major
update every twelve months once again underline the position of OpenVAS as
