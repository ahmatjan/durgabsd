<h2>OpenVAS Change Request #21: OpenVAS-Client: Improve Vulnerability Summary Listing</h2>

Status: Voted +3. Implemented with SVN 1921.

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>
To help users detect high priority vulnerabilities easier and earlier.
</p>

<h3>References</h3>

<p>
</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>
Vulnerabilities should be sorted from the most dangerous vulnerability
to least dangerous one.  In other words, the order should be High,
Medium, Low and not vice versa as it is currently the case in the main
view of the OpenVAS client for report summaries.
</p>

<p>
If the main window is not large enough, the summary of high priority
vulnerabilities in a report is even hidden and the user needs to use
the horizontal scroll bar to make it visible.
</p>

<h3>Effects</h3>

<p>
The three vulnerability types we currently have will be displayed in
reverse order in the main tree view.  The number of most dangerous
vulnerabilities will be easier to determine by the user.
</p>

<h3>Design and Implementation</h3>

<p>
The design of the tree view needs to be adjusted, the data store needs
to be organised differently (nessus/prefs_dialog/prefs_scope_tree.c).
Discovered vulnerabilities in stored reports and received from the
OpenVAS server need to be adjusted so that they are counted properly.
