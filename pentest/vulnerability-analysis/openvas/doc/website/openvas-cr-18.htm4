<h2>OpenVAS Change Request #18: OpenVAS-Client: Improve Handling of False-Positives</h2>

Status: Voted +3. Done. Functionality described here superseded by "severity override" features, released with openvas-client 2.0.3.

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>
  To improve usability and usefulness of the OpenVAS client with
  support for management of false-positives and of individual
  priorities.
</p>

<h3>References</h3>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>
  The current implementation does not treat false-positives at all.
  After a full scan of a target host the user is presented a report
  that contains server-defined priorities for each vulnerability.
  If there are false-positives (e.g. anonymous FTP or CIFS directories
  may exist on intention and not accidentally) the user needs to
  reconsider each such finding in the report manually.  This is
  subject to eat maintenance time unneccessarily for the user for each
  generated report.
</p>

<p>
  It would be helpful if the user would be given a way to alter the
  priority of certain scripts locally on a per-host basis.  Ultimately
  this would offer the user a means to treat certain test results as
  false-positives and to be able to downgrade (or even upgrade) the priority
  of other tests within the OpenVAS client.
</p>

<h3>Effects</h3>

<p>
  The results overview in the OpenVAS-Client and also its reports
  would be extended by additional information of applied individual
  priority overrides.
  The client GUI would offer a way to alter priorities in a form of
  a filter action, e.g.: a series of
  target-host/NVT-OID/[port]=[+-]priority
  rules.
</p>

<p>
  This feature affects the OpenVAS client only.  No library or server
  needs to be modified.
</p>

<h3>Design and Implementation</h3>

<ul>

<li>
  Modified priorities for checks are stored in the scope configuration
  file.  This requires support for integer values in nessus/preferences.c.
</li>

<li>
  Alter the internal handling of priorities in test results on a
  per-test and per-target basis.  This needs to be done in
  nessus/parser.c.  This will cause some code to be moved into a
  function to be generally available.
</li>

<li>
  Support false positives in all output variants of reports and in
  input routines.  This refers to nessus/*output*.c and nessus/backend.c.
</li>

<li>
  Adjust the OpenVAS client so that it will display false-positives
  properly in the summary and in the report.  This requires
  modification of nessus/prefs_dialog/prefs_scope_tree.c.
</li>

</ul>

     Initial text.</li>
<li> 2008-11-16 Jan-Oliver Wagner &lt;jan-oliver.wagner@intevation.de&gt;:<br>
     Rephrased and refined purpose, rationale and effects. Added the need
     of a data format.</li>
<li> 2008-11-26 Joey Schulze &lt;joey@infodrom.org&gt;:<br>
     Adjust the need for a data format to the use of the regular
     config file for a scope. Added the need to support all report
     generators.  Added file references to tasks.</li>
</ul>
