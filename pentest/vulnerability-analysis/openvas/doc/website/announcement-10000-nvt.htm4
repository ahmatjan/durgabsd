<h2>OpenVAS now beyond 10000 Network Vulnerability Tests</h2>

<p>April 9th, 2009</p>

<p>
Passing the 10000th Network Vulnerability Test (NVT) is a perfect
occasion to report about the progress of the <a href="http://www.openvas.org">OpenVAS project</a>.
</p>

<p>
In October 2008 the systematic development of new NVTs
started with a base of around 5800 Tests. With the release
of OpenVAS 2.0 in December 2008, the development was boosted
and has now reached an average of 10 code updates per day.
The public OpenVAS NVT Feed Service delivers 3-10 new vulnerability
tests every day.
</p>

<p>
The significantly grown and globally distributed developer team
will gather at the second <a href="http://www.openvas.org/openvas-devcon2.html">OpenVAS
developers conference</a> July 9-12 2009
in Germany. During the conference features and a roadmap for OpenVAS 3.0
will be scheduled.
</p>

<p>
The OpenVAS project is backed by a number of companies, which also
supplement the project with
<a href="http://www.openvas.org/professional-services.html ">professional services</a>.
These companies include Greenbone Networks, SecPod, Intevation and SecuritySpace.
"Reaching the professional enterprise market is a good indicator that
OpenVAS gained maturity very fast" says Tim Brown, founder of the
OpenVAS project.
</p>

<p>
While OpenVAS 3.0 will likely appear in 2009, users of OpenVAS 1.0
should prepare to migrate as support for 1.0 will end during 2009.
</p>
