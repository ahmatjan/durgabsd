<h2>Results</h2>

<h3>Session Results</h3>

<h4>Session: Interfacing</h4>

<pre>
* OSP
  * Unknown Severity:
    It was agreed that handling unknown severity throughout the whole
    vulnerability management causes significant effort and is error-prone.
    So it was rather considered better to make severities mandatory
    at the time results enter the Manager:

    * In case the wrapped scanner does not provide a
      CVSS-based severity, the OSP wrapper is responsible to define one.

    * At the same time this means that Manager should not accept
      results without severity.

    * For the special case of CVEs as NVTs, it could happen there
      is no severity. Here, OpenVAS Manager is actually the
      "scanner" to take care of. Thus it makes sense that the
      user can configure in "My Settings" which CVSS value to apply when
      none is present.

* Report Format Plugins:

  * Challenges: Templating & Duration

    * One option could be to use RST and Sphinx to produce
      nice HTML and then apply HTML to PDF conversion
</pre>

<h4>Session: Technology & Architecture</h4>

<pre>
* DB Performance:

  We do think there is still potentials to improve performance via
  optimizing queries. It is worth to spend 5 or 10 days of analyzing
  and improving the queries.
  We also need to gain more experience with PostgreSQL setups under heavy
  load.

* OSP-Scanners:

  * Adding dependencies to ospd like for ssh support?
    -> Not a real issue as it could be conditional. So yes,
    we like to add some higher level support functions/classes
    in ospd.

  * Results:

    Add "type = CVE | OVAL | $ScannerType" to replace current method
    of parsing the identifier string for "CVE" or "OVAL"?
    Or introduce OIDs for any?
    This is to prepare NVT meta data coming from OSP scanners.

  * Security:

    * It is desirable to drop the CA certificate requirement
      as it is in fact not needed and makes it complicated to
      do right.
      UPDATE 2015-08-28: Actually it is required, but the
      user interface does not explain and separate for better
      understanding. A solution based on separate Credential
      objects is desired.

  * Passive OSP Dispatcher:

    This idea describes a way to allow
    scan agents to contact a central dispatcher about scan tasks
    and to drop scan results. Using OpenVAS Manager as dispatcher
    is regarded the wrong idea because it implies security and load
    issues. Essentially a cache-and-forward technology is all
    we need for this OSP service.
    Thoughts were exchanged about chaining and meshing of such
    dispatchers. Routing was seen as a particular challenge
    as soon as it gets more complex than a chain of length 1.

* Security:

  Whenever using certificates, the crypto-algorithms could be checked
  whether they are acceptable and deny connection if not.

* Asset Management:

  * A full-flavoured explicit asset management is desired.
    We like to start with Hosts and OSs. Identification,
    history and the relation to results are key challenges.

  * When to add a Host? -> As it arrives. Possibly chunked if many.

  * Use something like Quality of Asset Detection (QoA)? -> We'll see.

* Next Generation GUI:

  * Browser-side stored data with JS to use them in a dynamic interface
    is desirable for user acceptance.

  * WebSocket technology needs review regarding security.
    A subscription-based event system could be implemented even without.

  * UPDATE 2015-08-28: A first step will only apply HTML5, CSS3 and selected
    Javascript (for example jquery) for the default face "classic".

</pre>

<h4>Session: NVTs</h4>

<pre>
* Faster Startup:

  For testing a new NVT, the start-up time of the scanner is a bottler-neck
  at least on some VMs.
  -> This is suspected to be related to disk IO. In trunk we have already some
  improvements of the scanner that might speed-up (reduced
  disk IO by using redis). More improvements are in the queue.

* Generic Controls:

  There are many controls in the Feed already. Consolidating them into
  a generic set seems desirable. This would allow for an easier Policy Builder
  in the GUI. Rough estimate was that there might be 50 to 100 base controls
  we could define.
  A challenge could be the multiple execution of the same control (e.g. file policy)
  It was agreed to select two controls and see how it can work out in the GUI.

* More profiling data from NVT run:

  * Is it desirable to have start, end, duration for each single NVT execution?
    -> We need a real world case that illustrates the need.

  * This could be fulfilled with an ACT_END plugin that would gather
    plugins durations which will be inserted by the scanner in the redis KB.

* Improved development environment:

  * Documentation:

    * We currently lack explicit documentation about the NASL API and
    an overview on standard KB keys.

    * A simple howto that describes step by step how to write a NVT
    based on a real case makes sense. Similar to the OSP guide at
    http://docs.greenbone.net/GSM-Manual/gos-3.1/en/osp.html#how-to-write-your-own-osp-wrapper

 * openvas-nasl:

   * Dependency pre-scan and auto-fill for "-X" would help to avoid accidental incomplete calls.

   * A way to make it work for authenticated scans is desirable.

   * It is desirable to see any keys filled by the dependencies and any keys consumed and filled
     by the NVT in question. The redis MONTIOR command might be a solution.
     This way a developer could easily match visually whether he might have misspelled a key somewhere.

   * Does it make sense to consider mandatory-keys in the way that indeed openvas-nasl will
     not execute the NVT if not fulfilled? -> Open Question - needs review.

* Automated NVT creation:

  It is desirable to get into more automation for the application level
  advisories. There are several applications where the vendors do follow
  a systematic advisory procedure. For these it should be relatively simple
  to establish.

* BIOS baselining:

  It is desirable to establish a check routine.
  In practice this could be complicated as the checksum method
  might need to be updated for each BIOS type.
</pre>

<h3>Other</h3>

<pre>
* Automated code quality checks:

  Greenbone already runs buildbot, so it was agreed to make it run upon
  any SVN commit, do cppcheck and other tests and send an email to the committer
  (or to the development mailing list) in case some problem was introduced.

  Code quality: Maybe add new tools to Greenbone's buildbot like Valgrind.

* Downloads of OpenVAS Demo VM:

  Any added bandwidth capacity for the Demo VM Download service is consumed by 100%.
  The idea was expressed to support Torrent for the downloads.

* Infrastructure: Wald Bug tracker is abandoned, which may make the
  project look dead.

* Next Release:

  In general it was agreed that the number of new features increased to a amount
  where a annual release cycle might be too long. Some ideas were discussed:
  * OpenVAS-8.1 in October and OpenVAS-9 in April?
  * OpenVAS-9 in October and OpenVAS-10 in April?
  * Always a release in October and April or only in case we have collected
    enough new feature?
  * Change to a variable release cycle (whenever enough features collected) instead of fixed dates?

* User / Developer Conferences:

  It was discussed whether a bi-annual cycle is sufficient for the
  increasing pace of OpenVAS developments.
  Ideas that came up are:
  * Switch to a annual cycle.
  * Co-locate a "small" developer conference at one of the Free Software
    events and possibly combine it with a user conference.
    It was agreed to keep open this option and gather more options and ideas.

* OpenVAS Project Management:

  * Re-arrangement of Steering Team: Tim to leave and we simply drop
    the "Administrative coordinator" or let Jan do this as well.

  * Gathering infrastructure in a single hand: It was agreed to gather
    infrastructure control via Greenbone as they proved as the most active
    and dedicated party and have enough man power for quick reactions anytime.
