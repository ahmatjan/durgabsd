<h2>NVT not found</h2>

<p>
We were unable to locate a NVT for the OID you provided.
</p>

<h2>Possible reasons</h2>

<ul>
<li>You provided an OID that does not conform to the OID scheme; a correct OID should
look like this: <i>1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.976</i>. Plugins with Nessus IDs have been
assigned legacy OIDs starting with 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.; that means information for the
nessus plugin with the ID 976 is now available using the OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.976.</li>
</ul>
