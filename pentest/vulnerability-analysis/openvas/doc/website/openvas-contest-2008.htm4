<h2>2008 OpenVAS Contest</h2>

<p>
  The 2008 OpenVAS Contest took place from August 23rd to October 15th, 2008.
  With 5 nominees who contributed a large number of improvements to the OpenVAS
  framework and extended the Open Source Network Vulnerability Testing, it was a
  great success.
</p>

<p>
  During the contest duration the number of OpenVAS Network Vulnerability
  Tests (NVTs) increased dramatically: from 3750 NVTs up to 5736 NVTs (an overall
  increase of over 50%). The most significant number of NVTs, which deliver
  full support for Gentoo and FreeBSD local security checks, were contributed by
  Thomas Reinke who deserves special thanks for his continuing support of OpenVAS.
</p>

<p>
  The OpenVAS developers and the sponsors of the OpenVAS Contest would like to
  thank all developers for their great contributions. The developers have spent a
  considerable amount of time on their submissions and have helped OpenVAS
  to become even better. These contributions will be included in the upcoming
  OpenVAS 2.0 release which will help to make the task of network security
  scanning easier worldwide.
</p>

<p>
  Since there were only three cash prices available, the OpenVAS steering
  committee and the sponsors decided after long deliberation to award the prizes
  to three new-comers to the OpenVAS team:
  <ul>
    <li>1st place (600 Euro): Vlatko Kosturjak</li>
    <li>2nd place (300 Euro): Chandrashekhar B</li>
    <li>3rd place (200 Euro): Christian Eric Edjenguele</li>
  </ul>
  Congratulations to the winners!
