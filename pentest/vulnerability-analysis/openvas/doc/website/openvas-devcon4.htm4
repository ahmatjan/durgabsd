<h2>Results</h2>

<h3>Whiteboard Content</h3>

<h4>Session: Interfacing</h4>

<pre>
* OMP
  * works well for many users
  * powerful
  * XML a bit complex for some cases
    * client required

* How about HTTP interface to OMP command set?
  * Would not require special client (wget could be used)
  * Needs simplifications

* RO access directly to DBMS

(Priority rating of these three items: RO acccess, HTTP interface)


* Pushing data from OpenVAS to 3rd party applications
  * Alerts send data upon condition (works)
  * Logging, works well except scanner
    * some OMP commands might be missing
  * Need SNMP Traps for security events "Single-Result-Alert-SNMP-Trap"

* CERT
  * via Feed or via user import (defining generic interface)?
* SCAP
  * Good enough as is
  * More data would not be a challenge though
* OSVDB
  * Makes sense because CVE/OSVDB/(EploitDB) almost 100% of
    relevant non-vendor advisories 
* Vendor-specific
  * Define generic interface

(Priority rating of these four items: Generic interface for
vendor-specific, OSVDB)

* Asset Management Systems:
  * Users desire easy, simple import and even link
  * but too complex, not critical
  * better not make "their problem" our problem

* Multiple, different scan engines
  * OSP
  * Requires some changes in Manager
  * Solves "import" of 3rd party scanner data
  * Non-IP addresses as a challenge (e.g. bluetooth)
</pre>

<h4>Session: Technology & Architecture</h4>

<pre>
* DBMS -> Replication / HA, Performance(?)
  * PostgreSQL
  * support SQLite (but: compile time)
  * for OpenVAS beginners to keep hurdles low

* OMP clients
  * GSA + CLI = enbough -> drop GSD
  * App? Wait for users with significant interest

* Asset Management
  * New DB model
  * Unified view for results/repository
  * Challenge: Identifiers

* Interface Awareness
  * configuring for bind
    * allow user to select on per-task basis 
  * codewise not a major issue
    * overwrite scanner prefs

* Control overall scan intensity
  * Thresholdm make adaptive, admin-controlled
  * not ware available resources

* Resource sharing (smb/ssh)
  * parallelism
  * log-pollution
  * target resource consumption control
</pre>


<h4>Session: NVTs</h4>

<pre>
* New Style description
  * Keep history of meta data
  * ASAP because trouble grows with each new user
    * first: history feature

* Some vulnerabilities only detectable via exploit
  * flag "exploit" or don't do it at all? -> explore feasibility
  * wait for exploit scanners via OSP?

* Malware detection?
  * systematic? -> No, we are not a AV
  * ocassionally as currently practiced? -> yes

* Policy/Compliance
  * need to improve work flow
    * split tests and reports/controls

* OVAL integration
  * via OSP, preferable remote, OVAL scanner
  * some management required in OpenVAS
  * Feed integration already there at admin level
 
* Formalized service detection
  * store into host details
  * consider naming scheme of IANA/Nmap
  * start with pilot, then change all

* Jump hosts (ssh)?
  * not all ports/tests (and only tcp)
  * alternative: reverse scanners
  * intrusive scanner change
</pre>

<h3>Restructuring OpenVAS Steering Team</h3>

<p>
After several successful years it was time to update
the steering group team. Responsibilities are to be reordered
according to available time to invest into OpenVAS and other
personal constraints.
</p>

<p>
It was considered to keep a simplified and flat steering team structure.
Everyone shared the impression that the most neglected task is Public Relations
and the most failing one is Documentation coordination.
However, for both parts we are still searching for dedicated volunteers
with long-term commitments.
</p>

<p>
The group agreed on the following new team structure:
</p>

<pre>
Administrative coordinator: Tim Brown
Development coordinator: Jan-Oliver Wagner
Infrastructure coordinator: Michael Wiegand
</pre>

<p>
The group thanks William Anderson and Robert Berkowitz for being part
of OpenVAS when the project was born and for so many following years.
