PAGE_START
<h2>OpenVAS Change Request #5: Remove BPF sharing feature</h2>

Status: Voted +4. Implemented with SVN 728. Released with openvas-libraries 1.0.1.

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>
To reduce code base.
</p>

<p>
To avoid potential stability problem with a feature marked
as highly experimental.
</p>

<h3>References</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://lists.wald.intevation.org/pipermail/openvas-devel/2008-February/000581.html">Discussion on openvas-devel mailing list</a>.
</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>
This feature was marked as highly experimental already in the old
Nessus times. According to the documentation the feature is only
relevant for BSD platforms where a specific kernel option is not
set and can not be modified.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, Flawfinder alerts about potential serious problems
that appear to not be solvable easily.
</p>

<p>
Apart from this, there seem to be no OpenVAS users that
use the feature (i.e., configure with option --enable-bpf-sharing).
</p>

<h3>Effects</h3>

<ul>
<li> It will not be possible anymore to compile with option
     --enable-bpf-sharing.
<li> According to the documentation inherited from Nessus it
     might thus be problematic to run pcap-aware plugins
     on BSD systems in case the kernel is or can not compiled
     with option "pseudo-device   bpfilter NUM".
</ul>

<h3>Design and Implementation</h3>

<ul>
<li> Remove the "ifdef HAVE_DEV_BPFN" block and only leave
     the corresponding "else" block in libopenvas/bpf_share.c.
<li> Remove option "--enable-bpf-sharing" from configure.in.
<li> Remove corresponding hints in README.BPF.
</ul>
