<h3>Conference Agenda</h3>

<p>
This is a collection of thoughts discussed on the mailing lists
<a href="http://lists.wald.intevation.org/mailman/listinfo/openvas-discuss">openvas-discuss</a>
and
<a href="http://lists.wald.intevation.org/mailman/listinfo/openvas-devel">openvas-devel</a>.

<p>
Please involve yourself there to express your ideas or needs.
</p>

<p>
Ideas collected so far:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Session 1: Presentations<br/>
     Chair: Vlatko Kosturjak<br/>
     (each 30 minutes + 20 minutes discussion)
     <ul>
     <li> Introduction to OpenSCAP, by Peter Vrabec (RedHat)</li>
     <li> OpenVAS-Metasploit Bridge, by Vlatko Kosturjak </li>
     <li> Lightning Talks (any topic, 5-20 min per talk) </li>
     </ul>
     <p></p>
</li>

<li> Session 2: Interfacing<br/>
     Chair: Henri Doreau. Minutes: Vlatko Kosturjak.
    <ul>
    <li> Which tools we interface already as consumer, as provider? </li>
    <li> Any inconsistencies and could this be streamlined? </li>
    <li> OSVDB integration </li>
    </ul>
     <p></p>
</li>

<li> Session 3: Technology/Architecture<br/>
     Chair: Jan-Oliver Wagner. Minutes: Henri Doreau.
     <ul>
     <li> Designing OSP (OpenVAS Scanning Protocol) to replace OTP </li>
     <li> How integrate SCAP standards and which ones? </li>
     <li> What are the next major trends? Do have to follow them? </li>
     <li> Re-architecting memory footprint of daemon (aka meta data in-mem
          storage architecture) </li>
     <li> How to improve the flow of remote tests? </li>
     <li> Make nmap mandatory requirement for OpenVAS? </li>
     </ul>
     <p></p>
</li>

<li> Session 4: NVTs<br/>
     Chair: Tim Brown. Minutes: Michael Wiegand.
    <ul>
    <li> low-to-log campaign: many NVTs output information as "low", but its actually just log info
         with no security relevance. A concerted action could reduce the low-noise a lot.
    </li>
    </ul>
     <p></p>
</li>

</ul>
