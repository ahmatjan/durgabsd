<h1>OpenVAS-7 Binary Packages (3rd party)</h1>

<p>
(OpenVAS-6: <a href="install-packages-v6.html">Download and Quick-Setup for OpenVAS-6 Packages</a>)
</p>

<p>
These guides help to get OpenVAS-7 quickly set up and started.
For productive use a more refined setup is recommended.
</p>

<p>
We highly recommend to run this check routine after you installed OpenVAS:
<a href="setup-and-start.html">Setup and start OpenVAS</a>
</p>

<p>
<b>Recommended:</b> Once you have installed OpenVAS, you should
<a href="http://lists.wald.intevation.org/mailman/listinfo/openvas-announce"
  >subscribe to the openvas-announce mailing list</a>.
It is a low-traffic list which helps you to follow all OpenVAS news and
important changes.
</p>

<p>
If you have trouble using OpenVAS, you are welcome to join the <a
href="http://lists.wald.intevation.org/mailman/listinfo/openvas-discuss">openvas
user mailing list</a> and ask for support there.
