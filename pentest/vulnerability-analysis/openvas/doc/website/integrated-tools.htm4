<h2>Security tools that are integrated into OpenVAS</h2>

<p>
This page is about security/auditing tools that are integrated into
OpenVAS.
<p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> This page is not actively maintained.
The list might not be complete or some entries might be outdated.
In case you would like to add your experiences here or propose further
tools to integrate, please subscribe to the openvas-discuss mailing
list and let the OpenVAS community know.
</p>

<h3>Nikto &mdash; a web server scanning and testing tool</h3>

<p>
Homepage: <a href="http://www.cirt.net/">http://www.cirt.net/</a>
</p>

<p>
Status (20080812): A NASL wrapper for Nikto is included in the openvas-plugins
package.
</p>

<h3>NMAP &mdash; a portscanner</h3>

<p>
Homepage: <a href="http://www.insecure.org/nmap/">http://www.insecure.org/nmap/</a>
</p>

<p>
Status (20080925): NMAP integration is inherited from Nessus through nmap.nasl plugin and used as portscanner plugin. Note that using nmap.nasl to directly scan high number of hosts is not recommended. If you're having large number of hosts to scan and want to use nmap, run nmap first on the hosts and then import them using nmap.nasl importer function. You can read explanation <a href="http://www.nessus.org/documentation/index.php?doc=nmap-usage">here</a>. <br />
Future (20080925): NMAP has capabilities of scripting called <a href="http://nmap.org/book/nse.html">Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)</a> which can also check for vulnerabilities. We're working on integrating nse scripts as plugins in OpenVAS. 
</p>

<h3>ike-scan &mdash; an IPsec VPN scanning, fingerprinting and testing tool</h3>

<p>
Homepage: <a href="http://www.nta-monitor.com/tools/ike-scan/">http://www.nta-monitor.com/tools/ike-scan/</a>
</p>

<p>
Allows OpenVAS to run ike-scan to identify IPSEC VPN endpoints.  It will attempt to
enumerate supported cipher suites, bruteforce valid groupnames and fingerprint any
endpoint identified.
</p>

<p>
Status (20080915): A NASL wrapper for ike-scan is included in the openvas-plugins
package. It has been tested against Racoon and Openswan and used as part of a
live penetration test against Checkpoint VPN-1 and Cisco VPN.
</p>

<h3>snmpwalk &mdash; a snmp information retriever</h3>

details)
</ul>

<p>
Status (20081024): Works with OpenVAS 1.0.x, see hints
<a href="using-slad.html">how to use SLAD with OpenVAS</a>.

<h3>ovaldi (OVAL) &mdash; an OVAL Interpreter</h3>

<p>
Homepage: <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/">OVAL website</a><br>
OVAL definitions interpreter: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ovaldi/">ovaldi</a>
</p>

<p>
In order to extend the vulnerabilty coverage even further, the OpenVAS project
is working on support for OVAL, the Open Vulnerability and Assesment Language.
</p>

<p>
Status (20090220): Proof-of-concept support for OVAL definitions is included in
OpenVAS, now including support for multiple definitions per OVAL file. Be aware
that OVAL support is only available in the 2.0 series.  OpenVAS-Server at SVN
revision 2578 or higher and a patched ovaldi 5.5.4 (see below) is recommended
for testing OVAL support. If you want to use OVAL definitions, the following
steps are neccessary:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Download <a
href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/ovaldi/ovaldi-5.5.4-src.tar.bz2">ovaldi
5.5.4</a>; this version is recommended for best results with OpenVAS.</li>
<li>Apply <a href="ovaldi-554-bugfixes.patch">this patch</a> to the ovaldi
source. This patch fixes a number of bugs in ovaldi which prevented ovaldi from
running correctly when launched from within OpenVAS.</li>
<li>Compile and install ovaldi.</li>
<li>Copy the desired OVAL definitions into your OpenVAS plugin directory; make
sure to change the file extensions from .xml to .oval.</li>
<li>Copy the OVAL schema definitions (the .xsd files in the "xml" subdirectory
in your OVAL installation) into your OpenVAS plugin directory.</li>
<li>Restart OpenVAS Scanner; clients connecting to this service will now see
a new plugin family called "OVAL definitions" in the plugin selection
section.</li>
<li>If you are using OVAL definitions that check for installed versions of
certain packages, be sure to enable the plugin "Determine OS and list of
installed packages via SSH login" (located in the "Misc." family)
and to provide login information for the remote machine.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Be aware that support for OVAL definitions is still in an experimental stage and
only a subset of all OVAL features is supported. Please report any bugs
to the openvas-devel mailing list.
