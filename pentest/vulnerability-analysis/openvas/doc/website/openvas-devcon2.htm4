<h3>Conference Agenda - July 9th - 12th 2009</h3>

<p>
This is a collection of thoughts discussed on the
mailing list <a href="http://lists.wald.intevation.org/mailman/listinfo/openvas-discuss">openvas-discuss</a>.
Please involve yourself there to express your ideas or needs.
</p>

<p>
A major goal is derive a master plan for the next 12-24 month
of development.
</p>


<ul>
<li> review the past 2 years of progress
<li> discuss core designs (towards OpenVAS 3.0)
     <ul>
     <li> Topic 1.1: tighter nmap integration (service detection, OS detection,
          network discovery, network scans in contrast to host-based scans
          and seamless integration of NSE scripts). Also relates to CR#26.
     <li> Topic 1.2: How to establish scan tasks like "all Windows machines in this network".
     <li> Topic 1.3: CR#23 and CR#24 and OIDs: Agree on standard family names and on subdirectory structures.
          Final layout and assignment procedure
     <li> Topic 1.4: Harmonization/unification strategies for NASL code
     <li> Topic 2.1: New concept of scanner/manager separation (many consequences like
          retiring OTP for client, having manager mandatory, ...). Big picture(?)
     <li> Topic 2.2: list of internal stuff we want to get rid of (like arglists, hash
          functions, use ini-file format). E.g. What can be replaced by glib functionality.
     <li> Topic 2.3: New base data structures for cleaner objects, APIs etc. (e.g. "struct NVT {}")
     <li> Topic 2.4: Reorganising openvas-libraries: to have a lightweight core and perhaps other
          focused libraries to suffice needs of client, manager, etc.
          Also includes reorganising OpenVAS-Client: Making dependency on
          openvas-libraries could reduce code base a lot.
     <li> Topic 3.1: Getting rid of NASL-based SSH stuff in favour of openssh(?)
     <li> Topic 3.2: discuss how to extend NVT coverage and how to retire NVTs
     <li> Topic 3.3: Replace the current internationalization concepts
          in nasl/server with a solution by standard technologies
     </ul>
<li> Managing OVAL (and other script types) via OpenVAS
<li> RDBMS data models for results, NVTs etc.
<li> Walkthrough of all the pending CR's
<li> Organising OpenVAS project (house keepers for web site, bug tracker,
     NASL APIs, PR etc.). Possibly assigning people.
<li> discuss professional services and how they relate to project
<li> meet the members of the OpenVAS mailing lists in real
     life and have beers (or other beverages)
</ul>
