</p>

<h2>The Answers</h2>

<a name="local_tests">
<h3>How are local tests conducted on nodes?</h3>
</a>
<p>
There are various mechanisms. 
<p>
For Linux systems SSH is used to connect and perform 
local tests and the SLAD mechanism can be used to 
perform more extensive testing (e.g. password 
auditing).  SSH functions are defined in the ssh_func.inc 
file. SLAD functions are defined in the slad_ssh.inc
file.
</p>
<p>
For Windows platforms the SMB and WMI protocol is used.

<a name="Iexpect">
<h3>I am not getting all the results I expect.</h3>
</a>
<p>
Many tests (both local and remote) require access credentials. 
Make sure they are filled out.
</p>
<h3>Why am I getting so few vulnerabilities in my reports?</h3>
</a>
<p>
