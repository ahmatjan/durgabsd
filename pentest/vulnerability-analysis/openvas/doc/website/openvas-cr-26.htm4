<h2>OpenVAS Change Request #26: OpenVAS-server: Introduction of more phases in NASL</h2>

<p>
Status: In discusssion.
</p>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>
To achieve better flexibility in NASL and better integration with external tools.
</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>
Currently, OpenVAS is host-oriented vulnerability scanner. That means that it forks
for each IP tested. There is some cases when it is memory-effective and speed-effective
to launch the scan against the hostgroup or whole targets. Launching nmap is one of 
the examples. 
</p>

<p>
NASL have following categories/phases: 
{ "ACT_INIT", ACT_INIT }, - phase to set KB items                                               
{ "ACT_GATHER_INFO", ACT_GATHER_INFO },                                  
{ "ACT_ATTACK", ACT_ATTACK },                                            
{ "ACT_MIXED_ATTACK", ACT_MIXED_ATTACK },                                
{ "ACT_DESTRUCTIVE_ATTACK", ACT_DESTRUCTIVE_ATTACK },                    
{ "ACT_DENIAL", ACT_DENIAL },                                            
{ "ACT_SCANNER", ACT_SCANNER }, - single host port scanner
{ "ACT_SETTINGS", ACT_SETTINGS },                                        
{ "ACT_KILL_HOST", ACT_KILL_HOST },                                      
{ "ACT_FLOOD", ACT_FLOOD },                                              
{ "ACT_END", ACT_END }, 
</p>

<p>
Proposal would add following categories/phases: 
{ "ACT_TARGETS", ACT_TARGETS }, - launched before ACT_SCANNER - executes NASLs on whole target specified
{ "ACT_HOSTGROUPS", ACT_HOSTGROUPS }, - launched after ACT_TARGETS - executes NASLs on whole hostgroup                                  
</p>

<h3>Effects</h3>

<h4>Advantages</h4>
<p>
This would,
<pre>
- help us in removing C plugins 
- provide better nmap(and similar tools) integration
- more flexible NASLs
</pre>

<h4>Disadvantages</h4>
<p>
additional work
</p>

<h3>Design and Implementation</h3>
<p>
This CR needs changing of openvas-libnasl and openvas-server in order to introduce two
new phases. As most of the NASLs are single host oriented, it might not be trivial task.
