PAGE_START
<h2>OpenVAS Change Request #35: OpenVAS-Client: Migrate from OpenSSL to GNU/TLS</h2>

<p>
Status: Voted +7. Done with SVN revision 4941.
</p>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>
To have a SSL implementation that allows for easier
porting to Windows operating systems.
</p>

<p>
To get rid of the OpenSSL license implications (exception clause
and advertisement clause).
</p>

<h3>References</h3>

<p>
(none)
</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>
Currently, OpenVAS-Client is using OpenSSL library
for handling the SSL-based connection to OpenVAS server.
OpenSSL is not well supported for Windows.
</p>

<p>
The OpenVAS server already was migrated from OpenSSL to
GNU/TLS a while ago. GNU/TLS is well supported for Windows.
</p>

<p>
Apart from this, OpenSSL implicates some sort of trouble
due to its license. It requires to handle OpenSSL exceptions
and to advertise OpenSSL.
</p>

<h3>Effects</h3>

<p>
Dependency to GNU/TLS instead of OpenSSL.
</p>

<h3>Design and Implementation</h3>

<p>
Best be introduced with a new release cycle (e.g. 2.1).
</p>

<p>
Changes will be similar to the ones in openvas-server.
Ideally, OpenVAS-Client should link libopenvas to use
the very same functionality.
</p>
