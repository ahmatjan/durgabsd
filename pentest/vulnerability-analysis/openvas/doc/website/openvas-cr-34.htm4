<h2>OpenVAS Change Request #34: Upgrade OpenVAS Server dependency from glib 2.6 to glib 2.8</h2>

<p>
Status: This change request has been obsoleted by change request #38 which
asked for upgrade to glib 2.12.
</p>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>
To allow using some newer functions of glib
and to reduce code on the OpenVAS side.
</p>

<h3>References</h3>

<p>
(none)
</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>
glib 2.8 offers a more comprehensive API.
So far wishes include these functions: g_mkdir_with_parents().
</p>

<p>
Version 2.8 was introduced more
than 3 years ago and thus is assumed to be generally available
for all current operating systems.
</p>

<h3>Effects</h3>

<p>
The most critical effect is that OpenVAS may not be compatible
with older operating systems. However, the conservative Debian GNU/Linux
carries 2.12 for "old stable" version etch already. 
</p>

<h3>Design and Implementation</h3>

<p>
The configure environments of openvas-libraries,
openvas-libnasl and openvas-server need to be updated
to require glib version 2.8.
</p>
