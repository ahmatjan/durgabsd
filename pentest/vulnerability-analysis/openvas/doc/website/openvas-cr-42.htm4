<h2>OpenVAS Change Request #42: Adoption of Risk Factor standard for NVT's</h2>

<p>
Status: Voted +4. Done.
</p>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>
To indicate Risk Factor in a standard way in NVT's through script_tag()
instead of embedding inside the description. Thus making it possible
to run statistics and other analysis for reports based on this type
of scoring.
</p>

<h3>References</h3>
<p>
</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>
<p>
Currently Risk Factor is being set in some of the NVT's as part of the
description text to indicate the severity of the vulnerability. There's no
standard format being followed by NVT developers. And since the risk
factor is hidden in the text, it can not be processed automatically.
</p>

<p>
The general goal is to to indicate Risk Factor in a standard way, through
script_tag() function like other attributes of NVT.
</p>

<h3>Effects</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li> All the existing NVT's that are using Risk Factor in the description text
will be moved to script_tag() function inside if(description) section of NVT.
Hence the Risk Factor will not appear as part of the report text in the Client
but instead it'll be listed as one of the NVT's attribute like script_cve_id
and others. For clients that do not show tags this means the user won't easily
see the CVSS values anymore.
</ul>

<h3>Design and Implementation</h3>

<p>
The implementation needs to incorporate the following changes:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Update all NVT's that are currently using Risk Factor to use,
script_tag("risk_factor", SEVERITY) format, where SEVERITY indicates the
likelihood of the vulnerability being exploited. Also remove the Risk Factor
that is currently embedded in the description.

<p>
The SEVERITY of a NVT (not to be mixed up with the severity a NVT can issue)
can be one of the following,
<pre>
  - None: The NVT is only gathering information about the target
    system and not reporting any vulnerability. Or it arranges things
    inernally such as setting special KB entries. This is was
    previously was called "Informational". CVSS equivalent is 0.0.
  - Low: The chances of the vulnerability being exploited is very low. In
    other words, CVSS Base score from 0.1 to 2.0.
  - Medium: The chances of the vulnerability being exploited is moderate.
    In other words, CVSS Base score from 2.1 to 5.0.
  - High: The chances of the vulnerability being exploited is high. In
    other words, CVSS Base score from 5.1 to 8.0.
  - Critical: CVSS Base score from 8.1 to 10.0.
</pre>
</p>

<li> Update the compendium describing the procedure to add Risk Factor in
NVT's.
</ul>

<h3>History</h3>

<ul>
<li> 2011-11-01 Michael Wiegand &lt;michael.wiegand@greenbone.net&gt;:<br>
     Make CVSS ranges match current usage and unambiguous.
<li> 2011-08-03 Jan-Oliver Wagner &lt;jan-oliver.wagner@greenbone.net&gt;:<br>
     Clarified ranges with "&lt;" symbol.
<li> 2010-07-24 Jan-Oliver Wagner &lt;jan-oliver.wagner@greenbone.net&gt;:<br>
     Updated status to Done.
<li> 2010-02-24 Jan-Oliver Wagner &lt;jan-oliver.wagner@greenbone.net&gt;:<br>
     Refined Rationale and Effects. Renamed risk class "Informational" to "None".
     Fixed Status.
