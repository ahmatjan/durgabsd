<h2>OpenVAS Change Request #3: Remove plugin factory from openvas-plugins</h2>

Status: Voted +5. Implemented with SVN 699. Released with openvas-plugins 1.0.1.

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>
To reduce code base.
</p>

<p>
To not encourage to write C plugins.
</p>

<h3>References</h3>

<p>
none.
</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>
It is desirable to not allow for writing any further
test routines in C programming language as they need
to be compiled anew for different platforms where
the server is running. C modules can naturally not
be distributed over a feed as the server system is unknown.
NASL scripts do not reveal this problem.
</p>

<p>
As a side-effect the code base can be reduced which is good for a higher
quality rating.
</p>

<p>
Another side effect is that less tools and directories are installed.
</p>

<h3>Effects</h3>

<ul>
<li> Users will not be able any more to compile their own C test routines
     based on a openvas-plugins installation. Of course, it is still
     possible to do so based on a openvas-plugin self-compiled tar-ball.
<li> For clarification: Neither are any existing C-Modules touched
     in anyway nor is it impossible to write C-Modules.
</ul>

<h3>Design and Implementation</h3>

<ul>
<li> Remove directory openvas-plugins/pf
<li> Remove handling of pf in Makefile, MANIFEST and configure.in
     of openvas-plugins.
</ul>

<h3>History</h3>

<ul>
<li> 2008-02-14 Jan-Oliver Wagner &lt;jan-oliver.wagner@intevation.de&gt;:<br>
     Initial text.
<li> 2008-02-22 Jan-Oliver Wagner &lt;jan-oliver.wagner@intevation.de&gt;:<br>
     Added some clarification to effects (it is still possible to write
     C-Modules and none of the current are touched).
<li> 2008-02-23 Jan-Oliver Wagner &lt;jan-oliver.wagner@intevation.de&gt;:<br>
     Updated status with result of voting.
</ul>
