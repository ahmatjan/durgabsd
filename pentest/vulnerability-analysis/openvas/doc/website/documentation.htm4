<h3>User Manual: Greenbone Security Manager with Greenbone OS 3.1</h3>

<p>
Greenbone OS 3.1 is based on OpenVAS-8. Several parts of the User Manual
can therefore be well used for OpenVAS-8. However, the installtion and setup
are substantially different.

<h3>OpenVAS Compendium</h3>
<p>The current Version of the OpenVAS Compendium is sadly deprecated.
It contains documentation and information that no longer applies to recent OpenVAS
Versions and should not be used as a reference for recent OpenVAS Versions.</br>
</p>
<p>
The <b>deprecated</b> OpenVAS compendium can be found in the
<a href=http://wald.intevation.org/frs/?group_id=29>OpenVAS files section</a>.

<h2>Call for documentation</h2>

<p>
While the OpenVAS development progresses at an incredible speed, the documentation
does not follow up at same pace.
</p>

<p>
We need more authors on books, manuals or helpful articles in various languages.
Also videos are welcome.
</p>

<p>
If you feel like one, please get in touch with the OpenVAS community.
</p>

<p>
If you know about good quality material that should be listed here, just
let the OpenVAS community know on one of the mailing lists.
</p>
