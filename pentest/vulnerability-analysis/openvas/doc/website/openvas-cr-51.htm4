<h2>OpenVAS Change Request #51: Add HTTP/HTTPS proxy support to openvas-libraries</h2>

<p>
Status: In discussion.
</p>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>
To provide a way to route HTTP/HTTPS traffic through a defined proxy.
</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>
Currently, the openvas-scanner access target systems directly. Sometimes,
especially for HTTP/HTTPS traffic, it is desirable to route the scan traffic
through a defined proxy, for example if this is mandatory in the scan
environment, for auditing purposes and for preventing the scanner to scan
certain sensitive URLs.
</p>

<h3>Effects</h3>

<p>
This would allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic to be routed through a defined proxy.
</p>

<h3>Design and Implementation</h3>

<p>
Since HTTP/HTTPS connections are can be established in multiple ways through
openvas-libraries, implementing this change will mean touching openvas-libraries
in a number of places, mainly nasl/nasl_socket.c, nasl/nasl_http.c and
misc/network.c.
