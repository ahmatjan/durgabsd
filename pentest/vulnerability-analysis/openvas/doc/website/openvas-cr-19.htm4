<h2>OpenVAS Change Request #19: Agree on a style guideline and on a format for 
the documentation</h2>

Status: Voted + 5, in the OpenVAS Compendium Rev. 2100.

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>
  To ease further developement of all OpenVAS modules. </p>
<p>
  To improve readability of source code. </p>
<p>
  To have an appropriate section in the OpenVAS Compendium for the people 
  interested in making OpenVAS even better. </p>

        code documentator.</a>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>
  In the OpenVAS code base one can find that too many different conventions 
  about code formatting and code documentation were used.
  This makes it difficult for developers that are new to the OpenVAS project to
  look at the code and get a fast overview.
  Furthermore, there is a certain lack of documentation, and no extensive 
  documentation of the API exists.
</p>
<p>
  There are guidelines given in the OpenVAS Compendium, but the section is short
  and no "standard" is stated.
</p>

<p>
  If the currently active developers agree on one style (e.g. on one favorite 
  file) this can be set as a standard for future developements and documented
  in the OpenVAS Compendium.
</p>



<h3>Effects</h3>

<p>
  This agreement and enhanced section in the OpenVAS Compendium allows current
  source developements to look the same, thus enhancing readability and reducing
  the currently high demand of reading and understanding the code at the same
  time.
</p>

<p>
  Furthermore it allows to use tools to automatically extract an API 
  documentation, which in turn can help the developers to understand OpenVAS.
  If this API documentation reaches a certain quality, it can be made available
  online and become included into -dev or -doc packages.
</p>

<p>
  Future developements would thus look the same and be documented. Old code, 
  however, would stay untouched. Style changes would become applied gradually,
  e.g. when code in the same file is touched, to not make svn blames too
  difficult.
</p>

<h3>Design and Implementation</h3>

<p>
  After discussions on the developers mailinglist, agreement fell on the GNU
  Coding Style Guide and the use of doxygen with Javadoc- style comments.
</p>

<p>
  A standard Doxyfile was added to the repository. 
</p>

<p>
  The OpenVAS Compendium was updated.
