<h2>OpenVAS Security Advisory (OVSA20160202)</h2>

<p>
Date: 2nd February 2016<br/>
Product: Greenbone Security Assistant &ge; 6.0.0 and &lt; 6.0.9<br/>
Vendor: OpenVAS &lt;http://www.openvas.org/&gt; <br/>
Risk: Low, CVSS 3.3 (AV:A/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
It has been identified that Greenbone Security Assistant (GSA) is vulnerable to
a denial-of-service attack due to a improper handling of UTF-8 in GET and POST requests.
Given the attacker has access to a GSA web interface, a respective HTTP request can
crash gsad.
</p>

<h3>Current Status</h3>

<p>
As of the 3rd February, the state of the vulnerabilities is believed
to be as follows. Patches have been supplied by Greenbone Networks which
successfully resolve this vulnerability. A new release of Greenbone
Security Assistant for stable release OpenVAS-8 has been created
which incorporates the patches. 
</p>

<h3>Fix</h3>

<p>
OpenVAS recommends that the publicly available patches are applied.  If
building from source, then patches r24264 and r24266 (for Greenbone Security Assistant 6.0.x of OpenVAS-8)
should be obtained from the OpenVAS SVN repository. For trunk (beta status of OpenVAS-9) this was solved with
r24262 and r24265.
</p>

<p>
A fresh tarball containing the latest stable release of Greenbone Security Assistant 6.0
(OpenVAS-8) can be obtained from:
</p>

<ul>
<li>http://wald.intevation.org/frs/download.php/2287/greenbone-security-assistant-6.0.9.tar.gz</li>
</ul>

<p>
In the event that OpenVAS has been supplied as part of a distribution then
the vendor or organisation concerned should be contacted for a patch.
</p>

<h3>History</h3>

<p>
On the 26th January 2016, Rene Behring reported the vulnerability. On 28th,
patches were applied and tests started.
Tarballs released and announcement published on the 3rd February.

<h3>Thanks</h3>
