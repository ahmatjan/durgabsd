</p>

<p>
Compatibility: VirtualBox >=4.3
</p>

<p>
Important Notes:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Security (it is highly recommended that you follow these steps immediately after first start):
<ul>

<li> You should change the default password for system account "root" (login as root and apply command "passwd"). </li>

<li> You should change the default password for system account "openvas" (login as openvas and apply command "passwd"). </li>

<li> You should change the default password for web account "admin" (login as admin via web interface and go to
     "Extras/My Settings". Via the Edit button, change the password - remind the checkbox to confirm password change). </li>

<li> You should delete the file "/home/openvas/.ssh/authorized_keys" as it may contain remains from the VM build procedure. </li>

<li> You should upgrade the base system immediately to install all security updates published meanwhile.
     The base system is Debian Jessie, so you need to run as <b>root</b> the command <tt>apt-get update && apt-get upgrade</tt> (or other management tools you might prefer). </li>

<li> A self-signed SSL certificate is used. You need to allow an exception in your browser at first login.<br/>
     Exchange it if you don't want to share the same certificate with other OpenVAS DEMO installations.</li>

<li> Encryption of passwords: The first time you create a credential object, a new password encryption key will be generated.<br/>
</li>

<li> TLS Ciphers: The services HTTPS and OMP can be configured regarding offered TLS ciphers.
     You need to start the corresponding daemons with the right parameters.
</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li> Usage:
<ul>
<li> If you don't know where to log into the web interface:
     The IP of the system should be displayed before the login prompt.
     Should it not be the case, press ENTER to request a new login prompt, in the meantime, the system should have acquired an IP and you should be able to use it.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> GNU GPL: In compliance with GNU GPL, any sources are already pre-installed on the VM (under <b>/root/sources</b>) </li>
<li> Performance: After import it might make sense to increase resources (CPU, RAM), given your host can provide this </li>
<li> Updating OpenVAS: OpenVAS was built in <b>/home/openvas/src</b>.
     You need to download newest releases as tar.gz files and follow the usual scheme for building OpenVAS from source. </li>
<li> Web timeout: If you want to increase the web timeout to for example 1 hour, then you should create a systemd drop-in file under <b>/etc/systemd/system/gsa.service.d/timeout.conf</b> with the following content (refer to the systemd documentation for more details):
<pre>
[Service]<br/>
ExecStart = /usr/local/bin/gsad --foreground --timeout=60<br/>
</pre>
</li>
<li> Alternative web interface ITS (IT-Schwachstellenampel, German only): As <b>root</b> enter <tt>switchface-its</tt>.
     Back with <tt>switchface-classic</tt>.
     Might help to force reload in browser after switch to get all decoration changes.
     This switch will be reset upon reboot of the system.
</li>
<li> You can switch the keyboard layout as <b>root</b> by using the recommended method:
     <tt>dpkg --configure keyboard-configuration && service keyboard-setup restart</tt>.
     Alternatively, you can use the following shortcut: <tt>switchkbd de</tt> to switch to German layout.
     This shortcut might not work in all cases.
</li>

</ul>

<h2>Important note on these Virtual Appliances</h2>

<p>
<b>
Please note that these virtual appliances are for
demonstration/testing purposes and not recommended for regular production uses,
particularly for more than a few hosts depending on local system
resources.  The OpenVAS scanner is resource intensive and may take
a long time to start on slower systems, especially when run as a
VM on laptops.
