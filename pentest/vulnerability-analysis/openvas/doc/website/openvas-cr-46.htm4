<h2>OpenVAS Change Request #46: Remove Session Saving feature from OpenVAS Scanner</h2>

Status: Done (completed with svn 7070).

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>
To remove a feature from the scanner that does not belong
there.
</p>

<p>
To reduce code base of scan core.
</p>

<h3>References</h3>

<p>
None.
</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>
Managing sessions is not the task of the core scanner.
It belongs to the management environment and thus
should be part of the openvas-manager.
</p>

<h3>Effects</h3>

<p>
This change would remove the OTP protocol commands 
SESSIONS_LIST, SESSION_DELETE and SESSION_RESTORE
as well as the OTP preference ntp_save_sessions.
</p>

<p>
OTP clients that do use these protocol elements
will loose this feature. They could use the
upcoming OMP equivalents though.
</p>

<p>
Also, this will mean to increase releases
to OTP > 1.0 and openvas-scanner > 3.0.
</p>

<h3>Design</h3>

<p>
This does not apply for the removal.
</p>

<h3>Implementation</h3>

<p>
Entire removal of the respective functionality
in openvas-scanner.
The conditional ENABLE_SAVE_TESTS is not used
consistently, so the removal needs some care.
</p>

<p>
In openvas-client are some remains of this
feature as well. These are deactivate since
a long time and therfore could be removed savely.
</p>
