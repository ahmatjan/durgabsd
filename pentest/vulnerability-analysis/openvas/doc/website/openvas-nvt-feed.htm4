<h2>About OpenVAS NVT Feed</h2>

<p>
The OpenVAS project maintains a public feed of Network Vulnerability
Tests (NVTs). It contains more than 45,000 NVTs (as of February 2016), growing
on a permanent basis. This feed is configured as the default for OpenVAS.
</p>

<p>
For online-synchronisation use the command <b>openvas-nvt-sync</b> to update
your local NVTs with the newest ones from the feed service.
The command allows <em>rsync</em>, <em>wget</em>
or <em>curl</em> as transfer method.
</p>

<p>
For offline-updates it is also possible to download
the whole Feed content as a
<a href="http://www.openvas.org/openvas-nvt-feed-current.tar.bz2">single
archive file (around 14 MByte)</a>.
However, it is recommended to use the rsync-synchronisation routine
because it downloads only changes and therefore is tremendously faster
after the very first full download.
</p>

<p>
The feed is usually updated weekly. The files of the OpenVAS NVT Feed are
signed by the "OpenVAS: Transfer Integrity" certificate. The presence of this
signature <b>does not indicate any judgement or quality control</b> of the
script itself. It is only intended to assist you in verifying the integrity of
the NVT files after transfer. Thus, a valid signature only means that the script
has not been modified on the way between the OpenVAS distribution point and your
OpenVAS installation. See the notes at the bottom of the overview on
<a href="trusted-nvts.html">Trusted NVTs</a> for more information on this
certificate.
