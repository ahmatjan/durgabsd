<h2>Retirement Procedure</h2>

<p>
The OpenVAS team will never retire an OpenVAS release
without notice!
</p>

<p>
The following procedure describes the steps that will be followed
to retire an OpenVAS release.
</p>

<ol>
<li> <p>
     A member of the OpenVAS development team
     is assigned retirement coordinator and is responsible
     for executing this procedure, keeping the timeline and
     answering any users feedback.
     </p>

<li> <p>
     Pre-condition: The successor major release must be available
     for at least 9 month before the retirement procedure starts.
     This means, the minimum life time of a release is 1 year.
     </p>

<li> <p>
     Email to openvas-announce Mailing List:
     </p>

     <em>
     <p>Subject: Support for OpenVAS-X to be discontinued</p>

     <p>
     Dear OpenVAS users,
     </p>

     <p>
     the OpenVAS release X has reached its end-of-life and
     the OpenVAS team plans to discontinue support for this release
     in three months from now at MMM, DD YYYY.
     </p>

     <p>
     If you still use release X, please drop a message via any of
     our support channels. If you can handle it yourself, you should
     soon upgrade to a newer version. Else, please ask for assistance
     for upgrading your OpenVAS installation.
     </p>

     <p>
     In case we receive feedback saying that upgrading the OpenVAS
     environment is not doable within three months, we are open
     to delay the retirement.
     </p>

     <p>
     Important:<br>
     After retirement of release X, the OpenVAS NVT Feed
     will not be fully compatible anymore with this release!
     The OpenVAS NVT Feed will be opened to NVTs that use new
     functionality introduced with the successor release and
     likely cause errors when used with deprecated releases.
     </p>

     <p>
     Best regards
     </p>

     <p>
     Your OpenVAS Development Team
     </em>

<li> <p>
     After 6 weeks: In case no feedback occurred about serious
     problems to upgrade
     to a newer release, at the retirement day the procedure is
     continued. Else a modified strategy will be followed according
     to the reported needs.
     </p>

<li> <p>
     The download section for the release X in the Download
     box on the OpenVAS website is marked "Support ends: YYYY, mmm, DD".
     </p>

<li> <p>
     A second email to openvas-announce Mailing List:

     After another 6 weeks: In case no feedback occurred about serious

     continued. Else a modified strategy will be followed according

     </p>

<li> <p>
     Removal of the download items in the Download box of the OpenVAS
     website.
     </p>

<li> <p>
     Email to openvas-announce Mailing List:
     </p>

     <em>
     <p>Subject: Support for OpenVAS-X now discontinued</p> 

     <p>
     Dear OpenVAS users,
     </p>

     <p>
     the OpenVAS release X has reached its end-of-life today.
     </p>

     <p>
     This essentially means version X is not actively supported anymore
     by the OpenVAS development team.
     </p>

     <p>
     Another consequence is that the OpenVAS NVT Feed is now
     open for NVTs that use the new features of release X.
     Still using the retired release of OpenVAS with the OpenVAS
     NVT Feed will likely cause internal errors. The old scan server
     will not crash, but you will get less complete or less
     precise scan reports.
     </p>

     <p>
     Best regards
     </p>

     Your OpenVAS Development Team
