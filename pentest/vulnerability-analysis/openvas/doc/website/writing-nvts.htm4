<h2>Writing NVTs</h2>

<p>
This text outlines what your should consider when writing
your own NVTs, i.e. NASL scripts.
</p>

<p>
Your are encouraged to join the
<a href="http://lists.wald.intevation.org/mailman/listinfo/openvas-plugins">openvas-plugins</a>
mailing list
to discuss technical issues. It is also highly welcome if you
coordinate there with the other developers about which security
alerts are dealt with or which general NASL libraries should
be added/improved.
</p>

<p>
Finally note, that some families are developed and contributed
continuously, they are listed on the about <a href="openvas-nvt-feed.html">OpenVAS NVT Feed</a>.
</p>

<h3>Script Header</h3>

<p>
The header is important to clarify purpose, authors,
copyright and license of the NVT.
</p>

<p>
We encourage to apply the <a href="http://wald.intevation.org/plugins/scmsvn/viewcvs.php/trunk/doc/source-header-stub-nasl.txt?root=openvas&view=log">OpenVAS stub header</a>
for NASL scripts.
</p>

<h3>Code</h3>

<p>
The OpenVAS has so far not set up any coding guidelines for NASL
scripts. Please take care your code is readable and well commented.
</p>

<p>
For the technical side, see the NASL Reference Guide available as part of
the module <a href="http://wald.intevation.org/plugins/scmsvn/viewcvs.php/trunk/openvas-libnasl/doc/?root=openvas">"openvas-libnasl" under directory "doc/"</a>.
