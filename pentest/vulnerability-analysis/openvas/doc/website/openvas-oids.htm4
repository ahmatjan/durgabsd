<h2>OpenVAS Layout for OIDs</h2>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> The support of the OID scheme was introduced in OpenVAS 2.0. To
stay compatible with OpenVAS 1.0 installations, it is recommended to apply the
old ID scheme as described below.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note also:</b> The refinements of the OID scheme are still in progress.
Please contact the OpenVAS development team for questions and especially in
case you like to apply OIDs.
</p>

<h3>Layout for old Nessus-style ID</h3>

<p>
The old IDs are integer values. They are assigned via the NASL command
script_id(). Starting from openvas-server 2.0.0, OpenVAS uses OIDs exclusively
and the script_id() command will automatically set the correct legacy OID by
applying the prefix 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0. to any ID.
