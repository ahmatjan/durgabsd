How to start OSPD-OVALDI

All OSPD servers share a set of command-line options such as
--help, --bind-address, --port, --key-file, --timeout etc.

For example to see the command line options you can run

$ ospd-ovaldi --help


To run a test instance of ospd-ovaldi on local port 1234:

$ ospd-ovaldi -b 127.0.0.1 -p 1234 &

Add "--log-level=DEBUG" to enable maximum debugging output.

Parameter for --log-level can be one of debug, info, warnings, error, or
critical (in order of priority).


Controlling a OSP daemon
------------------------

You can use command "omp" of the OpenVAS "omp-cli" module to send to and
receive information from the scanners.

Get a description of the interface:

$ omp --use-certs -p 1234 -i --xml="<help/>"


Starting a scan (scanner parameters can be added according to the description
printed upon the command "<help/>":

omp --use-certs --xml="<start_scan target='www.example.com'></start_scan>" -p 1234 -i


Show the list of scans, their status and results:

$ omp --use-certs --xml="<get_scans/>" -p 1234 -i
