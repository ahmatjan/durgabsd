About OSPD-ACUNETIX
-------------------

This is a OSP server implementation to allow OpenVAS to remotely control
a Acunetix WVS On-Premise system via command line interface.
OSPD-ACUNETIX initiates a web application scan for the given targets
and returnes the identified vulnerabilities.

OSPD-ACUNETIX is installed on the same system where the Acunetix WVS
is installed.

Once running, you need to configure the Scanner for OpenVAS Manager,
for example via the web interface Greenbone Security Assistant.
Then you can create scan tasks to use this scanner.

How to start OSPD-ACUNETIX
--------------------------

All OSPD servers share a set of command-line options such as
--help, --bind-address, --port, --key-file, --timeout etc.

For example to see the command line options you can run

> ospd-acunetix --help


To run a test instance of ospd-acunetix on local port 1234:

> ospd-acunetix -b 127.0.0.1 -p 1234 &

Add "--log-level=DEBUG" to enable maximum debugging output.

Parameter for --log-level can be one of debug, info, warnings, error, or
critical (in order of priority).


Controlling a OSP daemon
------------------------

You can use command "omp" of the OpenVAS "omp-cli" module to send to and
receive information from the scanners.

Get a description of the interface:

$ omp --use-certs -p 1234 -i --xml="<help/>"


Starting a scan (scanner parameters can be added according to the description
printed upon the command "<help/>":

omp --use-certs --xml="<start_scan target='www.example.com'></start_scan>" -p 1234 -i


Show the list of scans, their status and results:

$ omp --use-certs --xml="<get_scans/>" -p 1234 -i
