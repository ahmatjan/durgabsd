About OSPD-FORTINET
-------------------

This is a OSP server implementation to allow OpenVAS to remotely control
a Fortinet system using the Fortinet logging methods.
OSPD-FORTINET collects open ports for the given target systems. Ports
are regarded open if any response happened upon request in the past
time period (like 24 hrs).

Once running, you need to configure the Scanner for OpenVAS Manager,
for example via the web interface Greenbone Security Assistant.
Then you can create scan tasks to use this scanner.

How to start OSPD-FORTINET
--------------------------

All OSPD servers share a set of command-line options such as
--help, --bind-address, --port, --key-file, --timeout etc.

For example to see the command line options you can run

$ ospd-fortinet --help


To run a test instance of ospd-fortinet on local port 1234:

$ ospd-fortinet -b 127.0.0.1 -p 1234 &

Add "--log-level=DEBUG" to enable maximum debugging output.

Parameter for --log-level can be one of debug, info, warnings, error, or
critical (in order of priority).


Controlling a OSP daemon
------------------------

You can use command "omp" of the OpenVAS "omp-cli" module to send to and
receive information from the scanners.

Get a description of the interface:

$ omp --use-certs -p 1234 -i --xml="<help/>"


Starting a scan (scanner parameters can be added according to the description
printed upon the command "<help/>":

omp --use-certs --xml="<start_scan target='www.example.com'></start_scan>" -p 1234 -i


Show the list of scans, their status and results:

$ omp --use-certs --xml="<get_scans/>" -p 1234 -i
