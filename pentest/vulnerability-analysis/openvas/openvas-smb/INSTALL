INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR OPENVAS-SMB
=========================================

Please note: The reference system used by most of the developers is Debian
GNU/Linux 'Jessie' 8. The build might fail on any other system. Also it is
necessary to install dependent development packages.

Prerequisites for openvas-smb
-----------------------------

gcc-mingw32 | gcc-mingw-w64 libgnutls-dev perl-base heimdal-dev | heimdal-multidev libpopt-dev

Install prerequisites on Debian GNU/Linux 'Jessie' 8:
# apt-get install g++ cmake pkg-config gcc-mingw32 | gcc-mingw-w64 \
  libgnutls28-dev perl-base heimdal-dev | heimdal-multidev libpopt-dev

Compiling openvas-smb
---------------------

Create a build directory and change into it with

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build

Configure the build with

    $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/your/installation ..

or (if you want to use the default installation path /usr/local)

    $ cmake ..

This only needs to be done once.

Thereafter, the following commands are useful.

    $ make                # build the binaries
    $ make install        # install the build
    $ make rebuild_cache  # rebuild the cmake cache

Please note that you may have to execute "make install" as root, especially if
you have specified a prefix for which your user does not have full permissions.

To clean up the build environment, simply remove the contents of the "build"
directory you created above.
