# Description: Popt find script.
# Copied from: http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~inkscape.dev/inkscape/trunk/view/head:/CMakeScripts/Modules/FindPopt.cmake
# Modified by: Andre Heinecke <aheinecke@greenbone.net>
#
# Changes: - Find static version of popt instead of shared variant.
#
# - Try to find Popt
# Once done this will define
#
#  POPT_FOUND - system has Popt
#  POPT_INCLUDE_DIRS - the Popt include directory
#  POPT_LIBRARIES - Link these to use Popt
#  POPT_DEFINITIONS - Compiler switches required for using Popt
