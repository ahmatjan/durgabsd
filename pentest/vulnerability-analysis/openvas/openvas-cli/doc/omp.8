.SH DESCRIPTION
Together, OpenVAS Scanner (openvassd(8)) and OpenVAS Manager (openvasmd(8)) provide the core functionality of the Open Vulnerability Assessment System (OpenVAS), with OpenVAS Scanner handling the actual scan process and OpenVAS Manager adding various management functionalities to handle and organise scan results. 

The omp binary is a command line client which uses the OMP protocol to connect to the OpenVAS Manager and makes it easy to access the full functionality provided by the OpenVAS Manager conveniently from the command line and allows quick integration in a scripted environment.
