  replacement openvas-manage-certs is ready for use. This also means
  that openssl is not required anymore, instead gnutls (certtool) is now
  also used for the certificate management scripts.
* Improved support for IPv6.
* Simplify project version setting. Use SVN version at build time in
  binary instead of SVN version at configuration time. Make SVN revision
  retrieval work with SVN >= 1.7.

  It will now delete scripts not part of the when using rsync,
  except for the directory "private/".
  A Migration option "--migrate-to-private" of the sync-script will
  move private scripts into the "private/" directory.
  The Feed Sync will stop with an error until the "private/" is created.
  As soon as this directory is created, the synchronisation will ultimately
  delete all files in the local feed directory that are not part of the
  regular Feed.
* Newline in script tags are now escaped.
* The size of tags is not limited anymore.
* Internal use of NVTI references by OID to allow using the NVTI
  cache properly. This significantly lowers the memory consumption

  to the client initially.
* New: command line switch "--only-cache" to just build the cache and exit.
* Changed: The magic that NVTs of category ACT_SETTINGS were always enabled
  even when user disabled them has been removed. OTP clients now have
  to take care to enable as needed.
* Internal code cleanups for NVTI cache handling.

This is the second beta release of the openvas-scanner 3.3 module for the Open
Vulnerability Assessment System (OpenVAS). It will be part of the upcoming
"OpenVAS 5".

This release tightens security when using the external tool "ovaldi", enforces
the internal use of the UTC timezone and features an updated greenbone-nvt-sync
script.

NOTE: Due to the changes in 5.0+beta2, it is strongly recommended to delete the
contents of the OpenVAS Scanner cache directory to remove obsolete files and to
force the Scanner to rebuild the cache.

ATTENTION: The OpenVAS Scanner now enforces the internal use of the UTC
timezone. If the Scanner has been in use with an OpenVAS Manager, it is strongly
recommended to update to OpenVAS Manager >= 5.0+beta5 and to migrate the Manager
database before using this Scanner version to ensure data consistency.

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed to this release:
Matthew Mundell, Jan-Oliver Wagner and Michael Wiegand.

Main changes compared to 3.3+beta1:
* NVT management code has been updated to reflect the updated openvas-libraries
  API.
* The optional use of the external tool "ovaldi" has been made more secure.
* OpenVAS Scanner now uses UTC internally.
* The greenbone-nvt-sync script has been updated.

This is the first release of the openvas-scanner 3.2 module for the Open
Vulnerability Assessment System release 4 (OpenVAS-4). Compared
to the previous major release it contains a major cleanup of code, build process
and installation. This increases the efficiency of the OpenVAS Scanner, makes
the build easier and the installation compliant with the Filesystem Hierarchy
Standard (FHS 2.3).

Featurewise this release adds support for a network scan level, finally gets rid
of binary plugins (existing binary plugins were turned into NASL built-ins and
moved to openvas-libraries 4.0) and improves the handling of setting files. It
exposes the vhosts feature, changes the default port to 9391 and now listens on
IPv4 sockets by default.

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed to the 4.0.0 release:
Matthew Mundell, Michael Wiegand and Jan-Oliver Wagner.

Main changes compared to 3.1.x:

* Improved output of --version to comply with the GNU Coding Standard.
* Comprehensive code cleanup.
* Binary (.nes) plugins were moved to libraries and turned into built-in
  NASL methods.
* Handling of binary plugins has been removed.
* Added preferences for the vhost feature so that clients get them
  and can offer them to the user. In other words: unhide the vhost feature.
* Default port is now 9391 where the OpenVAS Manager expects the
  Scanner by default.
* Command line options "--dump-cfg" and "--gen-config" are removed.
* openvassd does not need anymore a "openvassd.conf" file. It uses
  its defaults and a possibly present conf-file can overwrite settings.
* openvas-mkcert got a additional switch "-f" to force overwriting
  certificates.
* openvas-mkcert does not create a openvassd.conf anymore as it shares
  the defaults with openvassd.
* Hardening flags are now enabled during compile time to increase code quality.
* openvas-scanner now listens on an IPv4 socket by default, even when IPv6
  support is present.
* The former autotools build environment has been replaces with a build process
  using cmake and using pkgconfig for dependency checks.
* Removed unnecessary log entries.
* Man pages have been updated.

Main changes compared to 3.2+rc2:

* The sync scripts have been updated.
* OpenVAS Scanner now uses pkg-config to find libraries.
* Installation of the openvas-services file has been moved to openvas-libraries.
* Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS 2.3) compliance has been improved.

* IPv6 support
* Integration of platform dependent NVTs from openvas-plugins
* Integration of openvas-nvt-sync script
* Renamed daemon from openvasd to openvassd
* glib dependency raised from 2.6 to 2.12
* openvasd-config removed as no other packages require this
  package for building.
* For the same reason, no header files are installed anymore

Main changes compared to 3.0.0-beta2:

* Adjustments for the API changes that happened from
  openvas-libraries 3.0.0-beta2 to 3.0.0-beta3.


openvas-scanner 3.0.0-beta2 (2009-09-28)

This release is the second beta version of openvas-scanner
leading up to the upcoming 3.0 release of OpenVAS.
Apart from the name change from openvas-server to
openvas-scanner, the platform-dependent NVTs as
well as the OpenVAS NVT Feed synchronisation script
are now integrated.

OpenVAS 3.0 will introduce a new architecture where openvas-libraries
now includes openvas-libnasl as well as redundant code from openvas-client
and where openvas-server is renamed to openvas-scanner and includes any
platform-dependent elements of openvas-plugins. As a result of this,
the source code will shrink, though new features will be added. Also,
for running the scanner now only 2 modules are required (instead of 4
as for OpenVAS 2.0).

New features of OpenVAS include support for IPv6 and WMI-Clients.
Version 3.0 prepares the new OpenVAS Manager and OpenVAS Administrator
as optional extension. This combination leverages the vulnerability
scanner to a comprehensive vulnerability management solution.

The "beta" releases are intented to allow testing of the upcoming
3.0 series. It should be kept separate from OpenVAS 2.0 installations
and not be used in a production environment.

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed to the 3.0.0 release:

openvas-scanner 3.0.0-beta1 (2009-09-23)

This release is the first beta version of openvas-scanner
leading up to the upcoming 3.0 release of OpenVAS.

openvas-server 2.0.2 (2009-06-03)

This is the second maintenance release of the openvas-server module for the
Open Vulnerability Assessment System (OpenVAS) 2.0-series.

It fixes some issues discovered after the release of openvas-server
2.0.1 and introduces support for new features. Thanks to the continuing
audit of the code, a number of obsolete, unused and/or unnecessary functions
were identified and removed.

Effects when installing this version:

* The option "Silent dependencies" is now "off" by default. Previously it was
  set to "on", openvas-client >= 2.0.2 has already switched to "off" per
  default. Note that this may result in larger reports.

* Dependencies: openvas-server 2.0.2 requires openvas-libraries 2.0.2 and
  openvas-libnasl 2.0.1. You need to install these prior to openvas-server 2.0.2.

* The openvas-adduser script will no longer allow passwords in plaintext for new
  users. This means that the openvas-adduser script will refuse to add a new
  user if neither openssl nor md5sums is available.

Main changes since 2.0.1:

* OVAL support has been improved and now supports multiple definitions and
  results in one file.
* Support for per-host password based local checks has been added.
* Debian packaging files have been updated.
* Dependency searching has been improved to work better with subdirectories.
* openvas-server will now generate a warning if a NVT could not be cached.
* The openvas-adduser script will no longer create the now obsolete "plugins"
  directory in the user directory.


Many thanks to everyone who has contributed to this release: Vlatko Kosturjak,
Jan Wagner, Felix Wolfsteller and Michael Wiegand.


openvas-server 2.0.1 (2009-02-17)

This is the first maintenance release of the openvas-server module for the
Open Vulnerability Assessment System (OpenVAS) 2.0-series.

It fixes some issues discovered after the release of openvas-server
2.0.0 and introduces support for new features. Thanks to the continuing
audit of the code, a number of obsolete, unused and/or unnecessary functions
were identified and removed.

Effects when installing this version:

* Dependencies: openvas-server 2.0.1 requires openvas-libraries 2.0.1 and
openvas-libnasl 2.0.1. You need to install these prior to openvas-server 2.0.1.

* Cache files: Effects of openvas-libraries 2.0.1 are changes in the
cache file management. With 2.0.1 release of openvas-server it is
possible to specify a new location for the cache folder. If you will
use a new location, then the effects described for openvas-libraries
do not apply anymore (see also below regarding cache folder).

* New default port of the server: Please be aware that openvas-server
now listens on port 9390 by default since this port has recently been allocated
by IANA for the Openvas Transport Protocol (OTP). If you want to continue to
use the old port 1241, you have to specify the port you want openvasd to
listen on, for example by starting the server with "openvasd -p 1241".
If you don't specify this, it might happen that at next boot of your
system (or other restart of openvasd), the service is available
at a new port and you need to update the connection information
in your OpenVAS-Client.

Main changes since 2.0.0:

* Support for sub-directories in plugins_folder in accordance with
  Change Request #24 (http://www.openvas.org/openvas-cr-24.html).
* Established automated source code documentation. HTML-Version is available
  under http://www.openvas.org/src-doc/openvas-server/current/index.html
* Openvas-server now uses the IANA-assigned port 9390 for communication
  with the client.
* It is now possible to start openvas-server without root privileges. Note that
  a number of NVTs which rely on operations requiring root privileges (like
  packet forgery) will not work under these circumstances.
* The openvasd-config script now returns the values for sysconfdir, libdir and
  sbindir set at compile time.
* The new server preference "cache_folder" allows you to define the location
  of the cache ($plugins_folder/.desc in previous versions). The default value
  for this preference is /var/cache/openvas for new OpenVAS installations.
  Existing installations need to add cache_folder = /var/cache/openvas
  manually to openvasd.conf and make sure the directory exists.
* The new server preference "include_folders" allows you to specify
  search paths for the NASL include directive. This aids the use of
  subdirectories for plugins. The default value for this preference is
  $plugins_folder to be compatible with the old "flat" (all in one directory)
  structure.
* Initial support for per-target SSH credentials settings has been added. Please
  note that you will need a new client (>= 2.0.2) and a new ssh_authorization.nasl file to
  use this feature.
* Having a directory structure in $plugins_folder is now supported. openvasd
  will recurse through the subdirectories in $plugins_folder.

Note: The OpenVAS NVT feed will not use the new features for subdirectories and
include paths as long as the OpenVAS 1.0.x and OpenVAS 2.0.0 releases are
supported. An exception might be OVAL support.

Bugfixes:

* The usage of the gettext support tool in support scripts like openvas-adduser
  did expect gettext.sh to be in /usr/bin, which prevented the scripts from
  working correctly on systems where this was not the case. The gettext usage
  has been made more robust. (Solves: #860)
* During startup, openvasd will now show the correct total number of plugins
  and not count signatures and other files anymore.
* The obsolete user-specific cache (.desc in
  /var/lib/openvas/users/USER/plugins/) is not created anymore.

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed to this release: Tim Brown,
Stjepan Gros (for subdirs feature), Joey Schulze, Jan-Oliver Wagner,
Felix Wolfsteller and Michael Wiegand.

openvas-server 2.0-beta1 (2008-09-25)

This release is a first beta version of the upcoming 2.0 release of OpenVAS.
It introduces support for the cleaned up and improved OpenVAS Transport Protocol
(OTP, replacing NTP), the new OpenVAS NVT OID scheme and support for the Open
Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL).
The protocol cleanup also removed some features that were considered unsecure,
unneeded or wrongly placed.

OpenVAS 2.0 will introduce a full set of new modules for OpenVAS Server
(openvas-libraries, openvas-libnasl and openvas-server) and a new
OpenVAS-Client. The only  module OpenVAS 1.0 and OpenVAS 2.0 will  share is
openvas-plugins. This means that the OpenVAS NVT Feed is compatible with both
generations of OpenVAS.

However, in case you plan to try out the new generation of OpenVAS, you should
install it separately from OpenVAS 1.0 installation. Instructions on how to do
this will be added to the OpenVAS homepage after all relevant modules are
released as 2.0-beta1. A separate announcement will officially start the beta
testing phase for OpenVAS 2.0.

Main changes in this release (compared to release 1.0.1):

* Updated packaging files for Debian.
* Support for plugin upload has been removed from OpenVAS-Server.
* Support for detached scans has been removed from OpenVAS-Server.
* Switch from Nessus Transport Protocol 1.2 to OpenVAS Transport Protocol (OTP) 1.0.
* New command line parsing implementation for openvasd (internal change).
* Fix for memory management issues in plugin scheduler that resulted in aborted
  scan sessions under certain circumstances.
* Updated scripts for user management; this fixes issues with new users being
  unable to login under certain circumstances.
* Initial support for OVAL definitions.
* Updated documentation.
* Switch from Nessus plugin IDs to NVT OIDs (internal change, also applies for OTP)

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed to this release: Tim Brown, Javier
Fernandez-Sanguino, Jan Wagner, Jan-Oliver Wagner and Michael Wiegand

openvas-server 1.0.1 (2008-07-03)

This release contains new and improved packaging files for various distributions
as well as bug fixes and cleanups. It also adds syslog support to openvas-server
and contains a first draft for the upcoming OpenVAS Transport Protocol.

Please note that this version requires openvas-libraries 1.0.2 or newer and
openvas-libnasl 1.0.1 or newer.

Please be aware that the plugin upload feature has been disabled in
openvas-server due to security concerns as described in
http://www.openvas.org/openvas-cr-4.html . This functionality is now deprecated
and will be removed in future versions of openvas-server. If your existing
installation depends on this feature, we recommend that you do not update to 
1.0.1.

* Added syslog support to openvasd logging facility.
* Fixed memory leaks in plugin scheduler.
* Added and improved packaging files for Debian, OpenSUSE and Fedora.
* Changed version requirements for openvas-libraries from 0.9.2 to 1.0.2 due to

First stable release with only minimal changes
compared to latest 0.9 version.
No problems or any sort of issues have been
reported for over two months now.

* Fixed tool "openvas-config" to output correct version
  of OpenVAS server (openvasd)
* During  installation routine, now a "gnupg" directory
  is created where the other configuration files of
  OpenVAS are located. This is the place for feed certificates.
* Removed some non-free documents (README_SSL, doc/WARNING.En
  and doc/WARNING.Fr).

openvas-server 0.9.1 (2007-10-17)

Minor cleanup release.

Main changes are:

* Version checking for openvas-libaries and openvas-libnasl
  at package configure time.

* Replace OpenSSL by GNU/TLS (therefore it is allowed now to distribute
  binary packages with SSL-support)
* SSL now mandatory.
* Many cleanups of ancient remains (still many to come)
* Removed various W32-specific elements, because W32 isn't
  a taget system anyway.
* Lots of renaming to avoid conflicts with parallel
  Nessus installation

. changes by Renaud Deraison (deraison@cvs.nessus.org)

- fixed the SIGCHLD handler which would not work properly and leave zombies
  on the system

- fixed a race condition when testing a great number of hosts which would
  cause a testing process to slow down a whole audit or even hang it
  totally

- When a great number of host names is passed to nessusd as a target, they
  are resolved by chunks of 64 instead of trying to resolve everything then
  starting the test

- RedHat 9 support (in spite of their attempt to make their distro incompatible
  with everyone else)

. changes by Gabriel L. Somlo <somlo@acns.colostate.edu>

- The nessus can save the reports to stdout and read them from stdin




2.0.3 :

- fixed a compilation error which would prevent find_services from working
  properly

. changes by Michel Arboi (arboi@alussinan.org)

- NASL port of smtpscan (original Perl program by Julien Bordet)

- Nasty bug made loop stop prematurely on rare cases

  built-in and is much faster

- Added checks for older Microsoft Advisories

- SMB plugins now use NTMLv1 authentication, ie: they don't send passwords
  in clear text over the network any more

- Added new crypto functions, taken from samba, in libnasl/

- Repaired detached scans

- Fixed IP ranges notation (10.1.1-9.1-254 did not work any more)

2.0.0 :

. changes by Michel Arboi (arboi@alussinan.org)

- NASL2 : Implement >!< "strings don't match" operator 
- NASL2 : fixed a vicious case of freed memory copy.

. changes by Renaud Deraison (deraison@cvs.nessus.org)
  
- Fixed a small bug in the plugin scheduler
- Ported to IRIX
- Several small bugfixes

. changes by Xueyong Zhi <zhi@mail.eecis.udel.edu>

- Added nmap_osfingerprint



1.3.4 :

. changes by Renaud Deraison (deraison@cvs.nessus.org)

- Re-written the process manager for the hosts
- Lots of bugfixes in the plugins text store manager
- New port scanner "synscan" which uses the RTT of the packets to do
  its job. 
- Fixed several small issues in nasl and nessusd (bug fixes, code cleanup)
- Added cryptographic hashing functions in NASL
- Added the function get_kb_list() which returns the content of a KB
  without forking the plugin
- Updated the manpages of nessusd and nasl

. changes by Michel Arboi (arboi@alussinan.org)

. changes by Michel Arboi (arboi@alussinan.org)

- Implement bit xor, logical & aithmetic right shift, power
- Fix operator precedence
- Added new NASL functions

. changes by Renaud Deraison (deraison@cvs.nessus.org)

- The plugin texts are not loaded in memory any more, thus reducing
  the consumption of the nessus daemon of two megs. This also speeds up
  the loading of nessusd.

- Fixed a bug in the plugins scheduler (if optimizations were enabled, 
  the scan would sometime hang)

- Added a new NASL function (int())

- Fixed strings substraction to handle null values properly

- find_services.nes runs in parallel mode, for improved speed

- new plugin (synscan) which should perform well against firewalled
  hosts (computes the RTT before the scan)

1.3.2 : 

. changes by Renaud Deraison (deraison@cvs.nessus.org)

- Added fixes so that nessus-core/nessusd/pluginscheduler.c compiles with
  the latest version of GCC

- Fixed a bug in nessus-libraries/libnessus/bpf_share.c : a timer would not
  be reset, causing plugins which call bpf_next() to sometimes crash

- Set the timer of bpf_share.c to a much lower value, thus making it work
  much better

- Improved tcp_ping()

- Fixed two bugs in the plugins scheduler :
	- If the option "enable dependencies at runtime" is set, 
	  it would enable ALL the plugins which are depended on, instead
	  of only those we use ;

	- In some cases, it may terminate too early, thus preventing a scan
	  from being complete

- DESTDIR support

1.3.1 :

. changes by Renaud Deraison (deraison@cvs.nessus.org)

- Rewrote the plugins scheduler (which determines the order in which
  the plugins are to be launched). The new one is much more efficient
  but as a result, it is not possible to accurately determine the
  order in which the plugins will be ran, so the 'plugin name' in
  the client is now totally bogus
  
- Fixed various issues with NASL scripts so that they work better
  with NASL2

- Fixed bugs relative to the creation of icmp and udp packets in nasl
  
- Fixed some fatal bugs in the bpf sharer

- NASL scripts do not read /dev/urandom any more, and use time() as a
  random seed instead. As a result, the loading and execution of nasl
  scripts if faster on systems where /dev/urandom can be blocking

- Fixed the tcp NIDS evasion techniques on BSD systems

- Full support for Bugtraq IDs 

- The HTML reports add links for URLs, and show the ID number of
  the plugin that issues the report.

- Speed up the calls to arg_get_value() by using a hash of the name
  being searched for.

- Changed the licence of NASL2 to the GPLv2 (with the consent of Michel Arboi)

. changes by Michel Arboi (arboi@alussinan.org)

  /etc/services and nmap-services)
- Added new families of plugins (ACT_KILL_HOST and ACT_END)
- Rewrote libnasl

. changes by Renaud Deraison (deraison@cvs.nessus.org)

- The 'cancel' button of several file selection dialogs is now working
- Optimized several plugins :
	- Web-related checks now use http_recv() instead of recv()
	- open_priv_sock_tcp() has a lower timeout
	- RPC related checks now use get_rpc_port(), a function equivalent
	  to libc's getrpcport() but with a much smaller timeout
	- Decreased the default value of checks_read_timeout from 15 to 5
- Fixed a bug in the plugin selection GUI which would not refresh
  the list of plugins of a given family properly (bug#3)
- Fixed memory leaks in NASL
- Fixed a bug in nessusd which would make it leak memory when receiving a SIGHUP
  (bug#10)
- Fixed a compatibility problem with Nmap 3.10ALPHA (bug#11)
- Nessus now accepts nmap's U: and T: notation for the port range (bug#5)

1.2.6 :


. changes by Michael Slifcak (Michael.Slifcak@guardent.com)

- Added Bugtraq cross reference in the plugins
- Added support for BID in nessusd (this has yet to be done on the
  client side)

. changes by Axel Nennker (Axel.Nennker@t-systems.com)

- fixed the xml and html outputs
- fixed array issues in a couple of plugins

. changes by Michel Arboi (arboi@alussinan.org)

- find_service now detects services protected by TCP wrappers or ACL
- find_service detects gnuserv
- ptyexecvp() replaced by nessus_popen() (*)
  
. changes by Renaud Deraison (deraison@cvs.nessus.org)

- Fixed a bug which may make nasl interpret backquoted strings
  (\n and \r) received from the network (problem noted by Pavel Kankovsky)
- nmap_wrapper.nes calls _exit() instead of exit() (*)
- Solved the lack of bpf's on Free/Open/NetBSD and MacOSX by
  sharing _one_ among all the Nessus processes. As a result, Nessus's
  ping is much more effective on these platforms
- bugfix in plug_set_key() which would eventually make some scripts
  take too long when writing in the KB
- Plugins of family ACT_SETTINGS are run *after* plugins of family
  ACT_SCANNERS
- replaced the implementation of md5 which was used when OpenSSL is disabled
  by the one from RSA (the old one would not work on a big-endian host)
- Fixed plugins build issues on MacOS X
- The nessus client compiles and links against GTK+-2.0. Of course, it will
  be horrible and instable, as the GTK team does not care about backward
  compatibility


(*) These two modifications solve the problems of nmap hanging under FreeBSD
  
  
1.2.5 :

. changes by Michel Arboi (arboi@alussinan.org)

- find_service now displays unknown services that run on assigned ports

- find_service sometimes declared IDENT as "unknown"

. changes by Renaud Deraison (deraison@cvs.nessus.org)

- Fixed a deadlock that would prevent some plugins from completing
- Fixed a possible (although rare) corruption issue in the reports
  (the script IDs could under some circumstances be random)
- Fixed a potential segfault in the execution of nasl scripts

1.2.4 :

. changes by Renaud Deraison (deraison@cvs.nessus.org)

- Reverted back to autoconf 2.13. 
- Bug fix in nessus-core/nessusd/pluginlaunch.c - under some circumstances,
  data might have be lost in the reports
- Fixed a bug in several plugins for web checks (under some circumstances,
  a plugin would do N x N checks against the remote web servers (where
  N equals to the number of web servers running on the remote host)

  and the end of the attack is logged (and not the time each plugin takes)
- Improved no404.nasl to further reduce false positives
- Bug fix in nessusd - under some rare circumstances, report data could
  be lost (if many many plugins were enabled at the same time and were
  sending data at the same time).
- UDP packets are resent while we wait for a reply (avoids to loose packets
  en route)
- Fixed the option "auto_enable_dependencies" which would not always work
- Sending a SIGTERM to the nessus client during a command line scan
  forces it to save its result to the current test file
- Non-printables characters are not shown in the report any more


1.2.2 :

. changes by Renaud Deraison (deraison@cvs.nessus.org)

. changes by Jordan Hrycaj (jordan@mjh.teddy-net.com)

- Fixed a problem in the random number generator

1.0.5 :

. changes by Loren Bandiera (lorenb at shelluser.net) :

- XML output in the Nessus client. 

. changes by Renaud Deraison (deraison at nessus.org) :

- added experimental KB saving, to prevent the audit to restart
  from scratch between two tests. See http://www.nessus.org/doc/kb_saving.html
  for details

- added experimental detached scans. 
  See http://www.nessus.org/doc/detached_scan.html for details

- bug in the test of DoS attacks fixed (thanks to Christophe Grenier,
  (Christophe.Grenier at esiea.fr))

- minor changes in nessus-adduser

- scripts that open a UDP socket read the result of a UDP scan first

- when it receives a SIGHUP, nessusd first frees memory. It also closes
  and re-opens the nessusd.messages file

- the plugin timeout is now user definable, in nessusd.conf

- 64 bit compatible (nessusd would produce warnings when running
  on some 64 bit architectures). Thanks to the SuSE (http://www.suse.de) team
  for having given me access to an IA-64 to compile and try Nessus.

- libnasl : better error reporting, minor bugs fixed


. Changes by Jordan Hrycaj (jordan at mjh.teddy-net.com) 

- faster cipher layer


. changes by Cyril Leclerc (cleclerc at boreal-com.fr)

- a GTK error would sometime be produced when the client is run in
  batch mode (Cyril Leclerc (cleclerc at boreal-com.fr))

1.0.4 :

. changes by Christoph Puppe (pluto at defcom-sec.com) :

- added "Sort by Port" to the report window. Saving of this is not finished.

- arglist_insert sorts first by holes, then by warnings, then by
  notes. Previous version only sorted by holes.

. changes by Renaud Deraison (renaud at nessus.org) :

- ftp related checks : the user can now supply a login/password
  for the ftp checks, and relies on the ftp banner if nessusd can't
  log into the ftp server (requested by Jens.Oeser at connector.de).

- libnessus : ftp_log_in() would sometime fail against some ftp
  servers

- better handling of large reports

- tests are saved on the server side and can be restored. Note that
  this is experimental and disabled by default. Do 
  ./configure --enable-save-sessions to enable this experimental
  feature, and read doc/session_saving.txt for details.

- better handling of targets with multiple web servers running

- continue to launch the DoS if the state of the remote host can not
  be determined

- fixed a bug in smb_login_as_users.nasl, and improved
  smb_accessible_shares.nasl

- added checks for unpassworded MySQLs and PostgreSQL databases

- nessusd uses less memory

. changes by Pavel Kankovsky (peak at argo.troja.mff.cuni.cz) :

- fixed a possible deadlock in the nessusd internal communication

- fixed a problem in the client that would make it crash if it received
  a malformed message from the server

- the client would not detect the death of the server when run in batch mode

- possible header confusion (with regex.h) fixed

- possible signal deadlock when exiting fixed
  
. Other changes :

- fixed a problem in the function is_cgi_installed() that may sometime
  not work against odd clients (Thomas Reinke (reinke at e-softinc.com))

- fixed a bug in snmp_default_communities.nasl (Lionel Cons (lionel.cons at cern.ch))
  
- fixed showmount.nasl (Paul Ewing Jr. (ewing at ima.umn.edu))

- typo in showmount.nasl would prevent it to work over udp (ctor at krixor.xy.org)


1.0.3 :

. changes by Renaud Deraison (renaud at nessus.org) :

- fixed various small problems in various plugins
- fixed a nasty bug in libnasl that would prevent raw packets from being
  read
- compiles under Solaris
- possible segfault in the client fixed


1.0.2 :

. changes by Christoph Puppe (christoph.puppe at defcom-sec.com) :

- Unified the naming of Vulnerability, Warning, Note in ASCII and HTML.

- latex_report_category seems like an oversimplification to me. What
  if we have a large network with lots of small holes, is this saver
  than a network with only one big? I've made a try on weighted
  rules. Hosts with holes get elevated to *10, warnings to *5 and
  notes stay where they are.

- added Level Note, it has it's own dot and is meant to be used for
  notes and notifications. The tex file is updated.

- changed smalies in various functions, to be easier to read, faster
  or more generic.

- plugins: finger.nasl was buggy

. changes by Renaud Deraison (renaud at nessus.org) : 
 
- possible hang at report time fixed in the client

- fixed a bug in the way the command-line client handles the plugins
  preferences

- fixed a problem in the detection of the servers that do not reply
  with a 404 error code when request an inexistant page

- fixed various compilations errors occuring on various
  platforms

- libnasl : fixed a bug that would occur in standalone mode

- nessus-libraries : takes the presence of the shared libraries
  of the system into account
  
- SMB and DCE/RPC over SMB issues :

   . smb_login.nasl : fixed an error (would always want
     to access IPC$ to declare that a login is valid)  

   . netbios_name_get.nasl : fixed an error which would
     prevent the SMB tests to work against Windows 2000

   . smb_dom2sid.nasl : LsarQueryInfoPolicy() now obtains the
     host sid, rather than the sid of the domain, so that local accounts
     are shown and tested (instead of the domain accounts only)

   . smb_enum_services.nasl : Lists the services that are running
     on the remote host

- new security checks added


. changes by Jordan Hrycaj (jordan at nessus.org) : 

- libpeks now uses the libgmp that comes with the operating system 
  if any, and does the same for libz
  
- fixed a bug that would prevent the client from working properly
  under OpenBSD
  
1.0.1 :

- nessusd : if the --enable-tcpwrappers flag is given to 
  ./configure, then nessusd is compiled with tcpwrappers support

- nessus : Pies and charts under Win32 too

- nessus : fixed errors when generating pies and charts which would
  cause horrible graphics (thanks to John Q. Public (tpublic at dimensional.com)
  for pointing this out)    

- nasl : memory leaks fixed, performance improved, bug in 
  forge_tcp_packet() fixed

- nessus-update-plugins : somehow improved

- plugins : more SMB checks, rewritten showmount in nasl, tons of new security
  checks (for a total of 435, whatever that means)

- plugins : fixed snmp_default_communities which was bugged. Thanks to
  W. Mark Herrick, Jr. (markh at va.rr.com) for pointing this out.

- gmp 3.0 is used by libpeks (vs 2.0.2)  

1.0.0 :

- nessus : fixed problems with the "spiffy" HTML export

- nasl : fixed various minor issues

- nasl : added the function ereg_replace()

- libhosts_gatherer : fixed a problem in the reverse lookups issues

- plugins : nearly 20 new security checks (including SMB checks)

- hinting to NESSUSHOME if ~/.nessusrc is not available (jh)

1.0.0pre3 :

- added the utility nessus-update-plugins(8). See the man
  page for security notes

- nessus : HTML reports now include links to the CVE entries

- nessus-adduser / libpeks : it is now possible to declare 
  from which host a user can connect to nessusd 
  
- plugins : better behavior of the CGI tests against hosts
  which do not issue 404 error codes

- security : nessusd.users would sometime be in mode 0644 (due
  to nessus-adduser), accounts.nes would let nessusd users read
  arbitrary files on the system

- nessusd : sends an error to the client when it attempts to scan
  a host it's not allowed to (suggested by Hermann Himmelbauer 
  <dusty@violin-kan.dyndns.org>)

- nessusd and nessus : error at loading time when the peks library was
  compiled with a special ./configure flag (thanks to 
  Bradley M Alexander <storm@tux.org>)

  overflow, Ken!, htimage.exe, lcdproc overflow, real server DoS, and 
  more...)

- nasl : added open_priv_sock_{udp,tcp} to open a socket with a priviledged
  port

  
1.0.0pre2 :


- nessusd : stop the current plugin when the user hits 'stop'

- nessusd : the rules now accept the keyword 'client_ip'  (suggested
  by  Hermann Himmelbauer <dusty@violin-kan.dyndns.org>)  

- nessusd : logs the name of the plugins that are loaded (suggested 
  by Matthias Andree <ma@dt.e-technik.uni-dortmund.de>)  
- nessus : the 'reverse lookup' option now works

- nessus : typo would prevent to compile nessus with gtk 1.0 (thanks to
  mike <michael.seeger@mchh.siemens.de> for pointing this out)

- nessus : changed the .nsr file format to something more easily parseable
  which contains the ID of the plugins which generate security warnings
  or holes

- nessus : error dialog makes more sense when nessusd is killed in the middle
  of a test (pointed out by Matthias Andree <ma@dt.e-technik.uni-dortmund.de>)

- nessus : fixed a segmentation fault that could occur during the login
  (Stefan Rapp s.rapp@hrz.uni-dortmund.de)

- nessus : the user now has the ability to select all the plugins
  except the dangerous ones

- nessus : fixed the busy waiting loop in the password dialog. For real
  this time. Thanks to Matthias Andree <ma@dt.e-technik.uni-dortmund.de>
  for pointing this out again.

- nessus : other cosmetics things have been fixed

- nasl : now supports user-defined functions (see the documentation
  for more details)  

- plugins : ssh_insertion.nasl : fixed a typo which would cause the plugin
  to yell when the user was using OpenSSH 1.2.2 (which is immune to this
  problem). Thanks to R. Pickett <emerson@hayseed.net> for pointing this out

- plugins : lot of new security checks (thanks to  Roelof Temmingh
    <roelof@sensepost.com> for pointing out some missing IIS checks)

- all : version check at startup, as suggested by Scott Adkins <sadkins@voyager2.cns.ohiou.edu>

  the user close the test window during a test

- nessus : saves the preferences of each plugin

- nessusd : fixed a problem in the rules which ended up being
  too restrictive

- nessusd : killall -1 nessusd now works  

- plugins : nmap_wrapper.nes : compatible with the new output of nmap

- traditional netmasks (255.255.255.0) are now accepted

- will not scan broadcast addresses (ie: 192.168.1.1/255.255.255.0 will scan 
  from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254)

0.99.10 :

- nessus : polished the GUI

- nessus : GTK 1.0 compatible (Eduardo Urrea <eduardou@hispasecurity.com>)

  happening a few seconds later the event happened. (this was occuring
  when doing few tests against a great number of hosts)    

- nessusd.conf goes back to ${sysconfdir}/nessus/ (and not
  ${sysconfdir}/)

- nessusd CPU usage : dropped from 100% to much fewer [thanks to
  Ryan Mooney <ryanm@mhpcc.edu> who pointed this out]

- nessus and nessusd : the target file may have an unlimited size
  (it was cut down to 2047 bytes in the past) [many thanks to 
  Boris Wesslowski <Boris.Wesslowski@RUS.Uni-Stuttgart.DE> for pointing
  this out]

0.99.8 :

- OpenBSD portability

- HP/UX shl_* support

- re-attributed the plugins category, thanks to the lists made by
  Jeff Odegard <jeff@digitaldefense.net> who divided the plugins
  into three categories : begnign, intrusive and potentially destructive

- the client disable all the potentially destructive plugins if they
  are not in ~/.nessusrc, and puts a warning sign in front of them

- plugins have been attributed a unique ID

- plugins are CVE compatible

- NASL now supports regular expressions through the ereg() function. The
  syntax of the regexps is egrep-style, that I personnaly like.

- several bugfixes

  big networks

- fixed a problem in nessusd which would make it slow down then crawl when
  it was testing big networks

0.99.6 :

- many segmentation faults corrected

- fixed a problem in the client <-> server communication which would make
  the server "forget" to send some data to the client

0.99.5 :

- New HTML export with pies and graphs

- Handles the HTTP redirects (thanks to  
  Andreas J. Koenig <andreas.koenig@anima.de> for requesting it)

- behaves well when the same service is detected more than once on the target
  side. Ie: if the target is running 2 web servers, then all the security checks
  will be performed on both

  cleaner way
- Corrected a bug in the client that would prevent it to work
  when not compiled with the cipher layer

- The quiet mode of the client will produce HTML, LaTeX, text or 
  .nsr files regarding the file suffix given as argument
  
- ASCII text output

- ${prefix}/var/nessus is created

- Corrected a typo in the code that would generate the preferences
  file

- Changed the behaviour of the nessus client, when it is started in the
  background and a pass phrase is wanted as input.  If available,
  the client terminates while complaining to the stderr.

- Added long options to the nessus client; as a side effect, the command
  line version works under windows, too

- OpenBSD portability issues

- Fixed the process tracker on cipher layer to meet the io thread
  table overflow

- Updated the process mgmnt, provided a general pty interface for
  subprocesses like nmap

- Reduced memory consumption by 50%

- Nessus can now use nmap(1). Thanks to Phil Brutsche <pbrutsch@creighton.edu>
  who helped me to figure out how to do this.

  Thanks to Michel Arboi <arboi@alussinan.org> for the suggestion
  (does not work well yet)

- The communication errors : 'out of threads already' and 'no cookie
  for received packets' have been fixed.

- All the newest security tests
