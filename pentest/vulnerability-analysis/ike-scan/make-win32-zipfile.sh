#
# This shell script creates the ike-scan Win32 binary zip file
# ike-scan-win32-<ver>.zip. It is used it to create the ike-scan windows binary
# package for each new version.  Most users won't need to use this script, and
# it can be omitted from binary packages without any loss of functionallity.
#
# It must be run under Cygwin after ike-scan has been configured, built and
# tested. It will not work on Unix or Linux systems.
#
# The resulting zipfile can be used on any Win32 system.
