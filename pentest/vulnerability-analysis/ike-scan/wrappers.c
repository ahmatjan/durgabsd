 * This file contains wrapper functions for system and library calls that
 * are not expected to fail.  If they do fail, then it calls err_sys to
 * print a diagnostic and terminate the program.  This removed the tedious
 * "if ((function()) == NULL) err_sys("function");" logic thus making the
 * code easier to read.
 *
 * The wrapper functions have the same name as the system or library function
 * but with an initial capital letter.  E.g. Gethostbyname().  This convention
 * if from Richard Steven's UNIX Network Programming book.
