# check-run1 -- Shell script to test ike-scan --help and --version
#
# Author: Roy Hills
# Date: 12 January 2004
#
# This shell script checks that "ike-scan --help" and "ike-scan --version"
# work.  These options don't use much of the ike-scan functionallity, so if
# they fail, then there is a fundimental problem with the program.
