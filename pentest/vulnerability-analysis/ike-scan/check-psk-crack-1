# check-psk-crack-1 -- Shell script to test psk-crack --help and --version
#
# Author: Roy Hills
# Date: 19 November 2004
#
# This shell script checks that "psk-crack --help" and "psk-crack --version"
# work.  These options don't use much of the psk-scan functionallity, so if
# they fail, then there is a fundimental problem with the program.
